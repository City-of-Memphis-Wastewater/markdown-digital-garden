Description: 
	Installed at the plant at the [[Equipment/junction box\|junction box]] just prior to [[Equipment/Headworks\|Headworks]] and other locations, to mitigate the escape of [[FailureModes/Hydrogen sulfide\|Hydrogen sulfide]] that is in the influent pipe. 
	Multiple installations, primarily for reducing odor / odor control.
	The BioAir system pulls significantly less [[FailureModes/Hydrogen sulfide\|Hydrogen sulfide]] volume compared to the [[Systems/BioRem\|BioRem]] system.

Monitor:
- pH
- conductivity, because it indicates the ratio of solids to liquids
