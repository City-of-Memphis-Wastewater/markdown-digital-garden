Installed at the plant at the [[Equipment/junction box\|equipment/junction box]] just prior to [[Equipment/Headworks\|Headworks]] and other locations, to mitigate the escape of [[FailureModes/Hydrogen sulfide\|Hydrogen sulfide]] that is in the influent pipe. 

Monitor:
- pH
- conductivity, because it indicates the ratio of solids to liquids

Key people or groups:
- [[Contractors/CDM Smith\|CDM Smith]]
- [[People/Carl Stevenson\|Carl Stevenson]]
- [[people/William Carrick\|people/William Carrick]]
- [[people/Michael Johnson\|people/Michael Johnson]]
- 

Multiple installations, primarily for reducing odor / odor control
The [[Systems/BioAir\|BioAir]] system pulls significantly less [[FailureModes/Hydrogen sulfide\|Hydrogen sulfide]] volume compared to the [[Systems/BioRem\|BioRem]] system.

The most substantial, highest volume [[Systems/BioAir\|BioAir]] unit is the wet well or the one on the [[Equipment/junction box\|equipment/junction box]].
