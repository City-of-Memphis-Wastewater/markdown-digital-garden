Email excerpt, Assignment clarification: ![[Gmail - maintenance_operation activities related to Biorem for 2023 and 2024.pdf]]
*The City issued a Notice of Transfer of Biogas to TVA to begin 2-1-2022 and began sending
production data to TVA semi-monthly. The City contracted with local contractor previously
used by Biorem to maintain the Biorem system on a weekly basis in 2022. The Biorem
system itself finally shutdown on 5-10-2022 due to lack of biogas and remained shut down
for the rest of the year. At about that same time, TVA paused commissioning their biogas
operation at the Maxson Facility due to apparent lack of planning and opted instead to visit
the current American Yeast biogas combustion operation at the Stiles Facility to see how
they do it. The Maxson Facility continued to service the Biorem even though it was not being
used. In September, replacement equipment was on order because Biorem vessel #3 was
not able to pump rinsate as efforts were made to get that equipment fully functioning when
biogas was available. Plans were made to rent a 300-400 cfm compressor in an attempt to
backwash the filter media.*
