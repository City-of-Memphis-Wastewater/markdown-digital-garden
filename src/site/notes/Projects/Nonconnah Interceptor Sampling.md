Contractors:
- [[Contractors/Malasari Engineering\|Malasari Engineering]]: Project management ([[People/Odell Johnson Jr.\|Odell Johnson Jr.]])
- [[Contractors/AECOM\|AECOM]]: Providing electrical engineering design, data, power design
- [[Contractors/RJN\|RJN]]: installing, maintaining, and operating the flow meters
- [[Contractors/Tioga Environmental\|Tioga Environmental]]: Taking samples

Flow meters are connected to the samplers. We want flow-proportional composite sample, which needs the flow meter to drive the sampler to do that. The flow meter drives the samples. We want to know how much flow is going to each [[Equipment/interceptor\|Equipment/interceptor]].

Maintaining samplers and collection samples
Twice a week

Waypoint reports, laboratory reports - data entered by [[Contractors/Tioga Environmental\|Tioga Environmental]] will be accessible on the SharePoint drive, 

Sampling at multiple (x2) points:
- NOI-S (five miles away from Maxson, midpoint, )
- Manhole #9
- Point on Presidents Island Lift Station

We blow forced airs into interceptors to improve air quality - this is primarily a contractor practice, and they tend to use diesel generators.
