### The Juniper Project Public Roadmap

This plan outlines a strategy for launching Juniper as an open-source project, attracting a community of maintainers and contributors, and providing value to users in the shortest possible time. The timeline is broken into three phases: "The Quick Win," "Building a Community," and "Sustainable Growth."

#### Phase 1: The Quick Win (1-2 months)

**Goal:** Provide an immediate, tangible benefit to a user so they can see the project's potential and get started with a simple demo.

- **GitHub:**
    
    - Create a clean, well-documented repository. The main `README.md` should be a simple, compelling story: "Tired of old Ovation graphics? This project lets you use modern tools to build beautiful ones."
        
    - Focus on the `1_asset_extractor.py` and `3_svg_renderer.js` scripts first. These are the most user-friendly and visually appealing parts.
        
    - Include a pre-built example (`assets/demo_boiler_area.json`, `assets/boiler_area.svg`). A user should be able to clone the repo, open the HTML file, and immediately see a rendered plant graphic in their browser.
        
    - The `2_svg_to_ovation_translator.py` should be present but in an early state. The `README` should clearly state its purpose and that it's a work in progress.
        
- **YouTube:**
    
    - Create a short, 90-second video. Start by showing a static Ovation diagram, then a transition to a dynamic, isometric view of the same graphic in a web browser using the project. Show how a single JSON file generates this rich output.
        
    - The title should be attention-grabbing: "Modernizing Ovation Graphics with a Python & D3.js Pipeline."
        
    - The video description should link directly to the GitHub repository.
        
- **Ovation Users Group Website:**
    
    - Write a short post introducing the project. Focus on the value proposition: "A new way to create sophisticated Ovation graphics."
        
    - Link to the GitHub repository and the YouTube video. Be transparent about the project's early stage.
        

**Success Metrics:** At least one user has successfully run the demo and posted a question or comment on a GitHub issue.

#### Phase 2: Building a Community (2-6 months)

**Goal:** Grow the project from a demo into a useful tool. This requires solidifying the core logic and making it easy for others to contribute.

- **GitHub:**
    
    - **Solidify the Core:** Use a [PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal)-like process](https://peps.python.org/) for new features. Create a `JUNIPER-JEPs` (Juniper Enhancement Proposals) folder in the repo. When a major new feature is proposed (e.g., "Add support for animated valves"), it should be documented in a JEP file, and the community can comment and provide feedback.
        
    - **Improve the Python Translator:** Prioritize a single, clear translation feature (e.g., transforming basic shapes and colors).
        
    - **Write Tests:** The `README` from the analysis document mentions a testing strategy. Implement this, showing that the core functions are reliable. This is critical for building trust.
        
    - **Define Contribution Guidelines:** Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file that clearly outlines how to set up the project locally, how to run tests, and how to submit a pull request.
        
- **YouTube:**
    
    - Create a longer, more detailed tutorial (5-10 minutes). Walk a user through the entire workflow, from a simple JSON file to a rendered SVG and the first-pass at a `.src` file.
        
    - Explain the role of each script and the value of the intermediate JSON format.
        
    - Release a "behind-the-scenes" video showing how a new feature is developed from a JEP, implemented in the code, and validated with a test.
        
- **Ovation Users Group Website:**
    
    - Post a new update on the project's progress. Highlight a specific, successful feature (e.g., "Juniper now translates tank levels!").
        
    - Actively engage in forum discussions, answering questions and soliciting feedback on new feature ideas.
        

**Success Metrics:** Several users have contributed code or documentation via pull requests.

#### Phase 3: Sustainable Growth (6+ months)

**Goal:** Turn the project into a self-sustaining tool with a community of dedicated maintainers.

- **GitHub:**
    
    - **Rolling Goal Setting:** As a maintainer, you'll be responsible for setting the project's direction. Use a "rolling" goal-setting process. At the start of each month, select the top 3-5 JEPs to focus on. Close out old JEPs and move completed features to the main codebase.
        
    - **Improve Extensibility:** Break the project into modular components. For example, the `1_asset_extractor` could become a package that supports different formats as plugins.
        
    - **Attract Maintainers:** Identify and actively mentor contributors who have consistently provided valuable pull requests. Officially invite them to become project maintainers, giving them more autonomy and ownership.
        
- **YouTube:**
    
    - Create a "Juniper in Action" series, showcasing real-world examples of how users are applying the project. This inspires new users and shows the project's long-term value.
        
    - Feature interviews with key contributors to recognize their efforts and highlight their expertise.
        
- **Ovation Users Group Website:**
    
    - Continue to provide regular updates and link to new features.
        
    - Start a new discussion thread or sub-forum dedicated solely to the Juniper project, allowing the community to support one another and share their work.
        

**Success Metrics:** The project has multiple active maintainers, and new features are being developed and implemented by the community with minimal intervention from the original creator.
