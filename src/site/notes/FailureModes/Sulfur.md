What are the sources of sulfur?
The less elemental sulfur that can enter our system, the better. This will help mitigate the creation of [[FailureModes/Hydrogen sulfide\|Hydrogen sulfide]] from [[Processes/anaerobic\|Processes/anaerobic]] processes, and to elimiate the production of [[FailureModes/Sulfuric Acid\|FailureModes/Sulfuric Acid]] when burning [[Chemicals/Biogasses\|Biogasses]]
