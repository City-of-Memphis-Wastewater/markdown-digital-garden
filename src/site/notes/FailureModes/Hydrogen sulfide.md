Chemical molecular formula: H$_2$S

The enemy.
Causes corrosion to our equipment, makes maintenance an uphill battle.
As a gas, H$_2$S can react with water vapor to form [[FailureModes/Sulfuric Acid\|Sulfuric Acid]].

It would be ideal to reduce all intake of elemental [[FailureModes/Sulfur\|sulfur]], such that H$_2$S and sulfuric acid could not form, but this is not realistic. Instead, we need to capture hydrogen sulfide gas at key areas: Using the lagoon covers and the [[Systems/BioRem\|BioRem]] system, as well as at the [[Equipment/interceptor\|interceptor]] and [[Equipment/Headworks\|headworks]] influent region, using the [[Manufacturers/BioAir\|BioAir]].
