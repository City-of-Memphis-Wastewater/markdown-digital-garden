Email excerpt from [[People/Henry Nakayama\|Henry Nakayama]]

*Hi Clayton, I just completed and submitted your poll[^1]. Glad to see that you are getting an understanding of treatment plant workings and issues.*

*The durability of #copper #wires and cabling around the plant depends on many factors:*

- *Wire gauge, thicker wires would take longer to #corrode*
- *Wire #coating, wires coated with tin or polymer (e.g., Conformal Coating) would last much longer*
- *Atmospheric conditions, wires protected from humidity (i.e., above the dew point) and #corrosive gases (e.g., hydrogen sulfide) would last longer*

*[[People/Henry Nakayama\|Henry Nakayama]], P.E., Senior Engineer/Special Projects Manager*

*M.C. Stiles Wastewater Treatment Facility, 373 Stiles Drive, Memphis, TN 38127*

*Office Phone: (901) 636-4370; Mobile Phone (901) 356-1839*
