Talk to [[people/Tersea Espy\|people/Tersea Espy]] at [[contractors/Diamond Scientific\|contractors/Diamond Scientific]] about calibrating [[equipment/SWG100 biogas analyzer\|equipment/SWG100 biogas analyzer]], the [[equipment/Optima7 handheld biogas analyzer\|equipment/Optima7 handheld biogas analyzer]], and the [[equipment/OptimaMax handheld biogas analyzer\|equipment/OptimaMax handheld biogas analyzer]]. Also the 6 [[equipment/Amatek biogas flow meters\|equipment/Amatek biogas flow meters]] which need to be calibrated, by [[people/Andy LeJeune\|Andy LeJeune]] at [[Contractors/Bar Environmental\|Contractors/Bar Environmental]]. If any of the flow meters cannot be calibrated, [[Contractors/Bar Environmental\|Bar Environmental]] will order new flow meters as we need them. We should have at least six spare [[equipment/Amatek biogas flow meters\|Amatek biogas flow meters]] on a shelf somewhere - where are they (ask [[People/Chris Luss\|Chris Luss]])? Also ask about where the spare [[equipment/SWG100 biogas analyzer\|equipment/SWG100 biogas analyzer]] is being stored. Move the storage of the flow meters and analyzers for the [[Systems/BioRem\|BioRem]] system to a rack in my office for now.
