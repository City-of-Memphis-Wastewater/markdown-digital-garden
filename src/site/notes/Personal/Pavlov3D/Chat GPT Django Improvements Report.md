I'll analyze the contents of your uploaded zip file and identify where unnecessary file uploads to the server might be happening. Let me first extract and inspect the project structure.

The extracted project contains Django-related files, including `config/settings.py`, which is key for managing file uploads. Next, I'll check where file uploads are being handled and identify unnecessary storage on the server. I'll look for Django file upload handling in views and settings.

I‚Äôve identified the key Django files related to file uploads:

- **`config/settings.py`** ‚Äì May contain file storage settings.
- **`home/forms.py`** ‚Äì Might define file upload forms.
- **`home/models.py`** ‚Äì Could have `FileField` or `ImageField`, storing files on the server.
- **`home/views.py`** ‚Äì Likely handles file uploads in views.
- **`home/urls.py` & `config/urls.py`** ‚Äì Could map upload endpoints.

Next, I'll inspect **`views.py`** and **`models.py`** to check if files are stored unnecessarily on the server.

### **Findings from Your Django Code**

Your **models.py** and **views.py** indicate that files **are being stored on the server unnecessarily**. Here‚Äôs why:

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem: FileField in Models (`models.py`)**

```python
class UploadFileModelForm(models.Model):
    file = models.FileField(upload_to="csv_uploads_pavlovdata/", blank=True)

class CSV(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    file = models.FileField(upload_to='uploadfiles/', blank=True)  # necessary? i think not
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

- **Issue**: These `FileField`s store uploaded files **directly on the server‚Äôs disk**, under `"csv_uploads_pavlovdata/"` and `"uploadfiles/"`.
- **Why It's a Problem**: If the files are meant for **Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, or another blob storage**, this is redundant.
- **Solution**: Instead of using `FileField`, store **only metadata** (e.g., file name, URL, size) and use **signed URLs** for direct client-to-blob uploads.

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Problem: File Upload via Django View (`views.py`)**

```python
from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage

fs = FileSystemStorage()
file = fs.save(uploaded_file.name, uploaded_file)
```

- **Issue**: `FileSystemStorage` saves the file **to the server before sending it to blob storage**.
- **Why It's a Problem**:
    - Unnecessary disk space usage.
    - Doubles upload time (first to the server, then to the blob).
    - Increases server load, making it hard to scale.
- **Solution**: Instead of saving the file, **generate a signed upload URL** and have the frontend upload directly to the blob.

---

### **üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Fix**

1. **Modify `models.py`**:
    
    - Remove `FileField` and replace it with a `CharField` to store the blob URL.
    
    ```python
    class CSV(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        file_url = models.CharField(max_length=500)  # Store URL instead of FileField
        date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    ```
    
2. **Update `views.py` to Use Signed URLs**:
    
    ```python
    import cloudflare_r2  # Replace with actual SDK
    
    def get_upload_url(request):
        """Generate signed URL for direct upload to Cloudflare R2"""
        blob_url = cloudflare_r2.generate_signed_upload_url()
        return JsonResponse({"upload_url": blob_url})
    ```
    
3. **Frontend Updates**:
    
    - Instead of sending files to Django, the frontend should upload **directly to Cloudflare R2** using the signed URL.

---

### **üöÄ Result**

‚úÖ No more temporary files on the server.  
‚úÖ Faster uploads since files go **directly to blob storage**.  
‚úÖ **More scalable & secure** than handling uploads in Django.

Would you like me to help adjust your `views.py` to implement these fixes? üöÄ

# views.py updated:

```
import json
import boto3  # Using boto3 for Cloudflare R2 (compatible with S3 API)
from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.conf import settings

def get_upload_url(request):
    """Generates a signed URL for direct file upload to Cloudflare R2."""
    s3_client = boto3.client(
        's3',
        endpoint_url=settings.CLOUDFLARE_R2_ENDPOINT,
        aws_access_key_id=settings.CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
        aws_secret_access_key=settings.CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
    )
    
    bucket_name = settings.CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET
    file_name = request.GET.get('file_name', 'uploadfile')
    
    try:
        signed_url = s3_client.generate_presigned_url(
            'put_object',
            Params={'Bucket': bucket_name, 'Key': file_name},
            ExpiresIn=3600  # URL valid for 1 hour
        )
        return JsonResponse({"upload_url": signed_url})
    except Exception as e:
        return JsonResponse({"error": str(e)}, status=500)

def save_file_metadata(request):
    """Stores file metadata in the database after upload."""
    if request.method == 'POST':
        data = json.loads(request.body)
        file_url = data.get('file_url')
        title = data.get('title', 'Untitled')
        
        from home.models import CSV  # Import the model here
        new_file = CSV(title=title, file_url=file_url)
        new_file.save()
        
        return JsonResponse({"message": "File metadata saved!"})
    
    return JsonResponse({"error": "Invalid request"}, status=400)

```

I'll now modify your `views.py` to remove unnecessary file storage and implement **signed URL generation for direct uploads to Cloudflare R2**.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do:  
‚úÖ **Remove `FileSystemStorage`** (eliminates temporary file storage).  
‚úÖ **Add a function to generate signed upload URLs**.  
‚úÖ **Update views to handle blob storage correctly**.

Let me make these changes now.

### **üîπ What This Update Does**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **`get_upload_url`** ‚Üí Generates a **signed URL** for direct file upload to **Cloudflare R2**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **`save_file_metadata`** ‚Üí Stores **file metadata (URL & title) in the database** after upload.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **No more unnecessary file storage on the Django server**‚Äîuploads go **directly to R2**.

### **üöÄ Next Steps**

- **Frontend should use the signed URL** for file uploads.
- If needed, I can help **modify the frontend code** to send files directly to Cloudflare R2.

Let me know if you need further refinements! üòä
