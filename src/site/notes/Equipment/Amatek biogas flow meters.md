We have 6 of these.
Calibration procedure: Based on temperature. Send back to the [[Manufacturers/Amatek\|Amatek]] factory for calibration. They maintain a water bath as a constant temperature and see if the reading is accurate.
This flow meter is a [[Information Heap/hot-wire anemometer\|information heap/hot-wire anemometer]].
AKA Amatek "Mass Flow Sensors"

Similar to this model: [Echotel 961 962 single- and dual-point ultrasonic level switches](https://www.ametek-measurement.com/solutions/magnetrol/echotel-961-962-single--and-dual-point-ultrasonic-level-switches)
Check with [[People/Chris Luss\|Chris Luss]] for precise model / serial number.
The calibration certificates correlate with the serial number for each sensor, and must be included in the report to [[Government/Shelby County Health Department\|government/Shelby County Health Department]].
