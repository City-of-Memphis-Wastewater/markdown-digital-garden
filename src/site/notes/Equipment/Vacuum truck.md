Vacuum sludge from sludge boxes on primary clarifiers, then drive to lagoon area, where sludge is dumped into a particular pit. Back the vacuum truck up to the berm before dumping - technically a spotter is specified to be present when backing up the truck to the berm.

We would like to get a paint pen marked on the lug nuts, to allow for easier daily inspection, by [[people/Josh\|Josh]].
