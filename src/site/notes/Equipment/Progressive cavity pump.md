Maintenance issue solution soft durometer chrome stators
Double chrome plating to increase thickness of coating
Safeguard - auto turn off at high pressure
Replace rotor twice between one stator
Check effectiveness through volumetric discharge compared to inflow

Brand: Moyno
Stator lining is made of hard rubber

Once the stator wears, the RPM no longer correlates reliably with flow

Failure mode: wear on rubber stator and chrome plating

Created by  [René Moineau](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Moineau "fr:René Moineau"), in 1930, while trying to make a jet engine compressor
