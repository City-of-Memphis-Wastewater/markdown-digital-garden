*Hi Sammy, I assume that you were able to scope out the locations for the H2O2 dosing for the TE Maxson influent and the Solae caustic shocking. Were you able to find suitable locations for staging tanks and equipment at those locations? Do you have any drawings showing where you plan to setup tanks and equipment? If you need any additional information please let us know. Thanks.*

*Also, the TE Maxson WWTF has a new engineer, George “Clayton” Bennett, who will be involved with this project. Please copy Clayton in our discussions. Thanks.*
