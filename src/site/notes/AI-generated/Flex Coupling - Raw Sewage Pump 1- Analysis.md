How to properly size a flex coupling between a rigid motor shaft and a pump shaft with a single floating bearing
# ChatGPT 0:

To **properly size a flexible coupling** between a **rigid motor shaft** and a **pump shaft with a single floating bearing**, you need to consider both **mechanical performance requirements** and **alignment tolerances**. Here‚Äôs a structured approach:

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 1. **Understand the Application Parameters**

Gather the following:

- **Power transmitted (kW or HP)**
    
- **Shaft speeds (RPM)**
    
- **Shaft diameters (motor and pump)**
    
- **Type and magnitude of misalignment**:
    
    - Angular
        
    - Parallel (radial)
        
    - Axial movement (important with a floating bearing)
        
- **Distance between shaft ends (DBSE)**
    
- **Duty cycle and start/stop frequency**
    
- **Environmental factors** (temperature, dust, fluids, etc.)
    

---

### üìê 2. **Account for the Floating Bearing**

A **single floating bearing** on the pump shaft means:

- The **pump shaft will move axially** during thermal expansion or load changes.
    
- The coupling **must accommodate axial movement** without transmitting axial loads to the motor bearing (which is likely fixed).
    
- This rules out **rigid or limited-flex couplings**.
    

‚úÖ **Use a coupling with high axial flexibility**, such as:

- **Double-flex disc couplings**
    
- **Bellows couplings**
    
- **Flexible grid couplings**
    
- **Elastomeric (jaw or tire) couplings** (depending on precision needed)
    

---

### üîß 3. **Coupling Sizing Procedure**

#### Step A: Calculate Required Torque

T=9550√óPNT = \frac{9550 \times P}{N}

Where:

- TT = Torque (Nm)
    
- PP = Power (kW)
    
- NN = Speed (RPM)
    

Apply a **service factor (SF)** based on:

- Load type (uniform, moderate shock, heavy shock)
    
- Start/stop frequency
    

Tdesign=T√óSFT_{design} = T \times SF

#### Step B: Match Shaft Diameters

Ensure the coupling can:

- Fit both shaft diameters
    
- Be bored or bushed accordingly
    

#### Step C: Check Misalignment Tolerance

- **Angular:** usually < 1¬∞
    
- **Parallel:** up to a few mm
    
- **Axial float:** ensure it handles the full axial movement range of the pump shaft
    

---

### üìè 4. **Final Selection**

Choose a coupling that:

- Transmits at least the **design torque**
    
- Fits **both shafts** (or is available with reducers)
    
- Accommodates the expected **misalignment**
    
- Allows enough **axial float** (floating bearing movement)
    

---

### üß∞ Tip: Safety and Installation

- **Proper alignment** during installation reduces coupling and bearing wear.
    
- Use **dial indicators or laser alignment tools** if high precision is needed.
    
- Check **mounting length** and **clearance** for axial movement.
