How to properly size a flex coupling between a rigid motor shaft and a pump shaft with a single floating bearing
# ChatGPT 0:

To **properly size a flexible coupling** between a **rigid motor shaft** and a **pump shaft with a single floating bearing**, you need to consider both **mechanical performance requirements** and **alignment tolerances**. Here‚Äôs a structured approach:

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 1. **Understand the Application Parameters**

Gather the following:

- **Power transmitted (kW or HP)**
    
- **Shaft speeds (RPM)**
    
- **Shaft diameters (motor and pump)**
    
- **Type and magnitude of misalignment**:
    
    - Angular
        
    - Parallel (radial)
        
    - Axial movement (important with a floating bearing)
        
- **Distance between shaft ends (DBSE)**
    
- **Duty cycle and start/stop frequency**
    
- **Environmental factors** (temperature, dust, fluids, etc.)
    

---

### üìê 2. **Account for the Floating Bearing**

A **single floating bearing** on the pump shaft means:

- The **pump shaft will move axially** during thermal expansion or load changes.
    
- The coupling **must accommodate axial movement** without transmitting axial loads to the motor bearing (which is likely fixed).
    
- This rules out **rigid or limited-flex couplings**.
    

‚úÖ **Use a coupling with high axial flexibility**, such as:

- **Double-flex disc couplings**
    
- **Bellows couplings**
    
- **Flexible grid couplings**
    
- **Elastomeric (jaw or tire) couplings** (depending on precision needed)
    

---

### üîß 3. **Coupling Sizing Procedure**

#### Step A: Calculate Required Torque

T=9550√óPNT = \frac{9550 \times P}{N}

Where:

- TT = Torque (Nm)
    
- PP = Power (kW)
    
- NN = Speed (RPM)
    

Apply a **service factor (SF)** based on:

- Load type (uniform, moderate shock, heavy shock)
    
- Start/stop frequency
    

Tdesign=T√óSFT_{design} = T \times SF

#### Step B: Match Shaft Diameters

Ensure the coupling can:

- Fit both shaft diameters
    
- Be bored or bushed accordingly
    

#### Step C: Check Misalignment Tolerance

- **Angular:** usually < 1¬∞
    
- **Parallel:** up to a few mm
    
- **Axial float:** ensure it handles the full axial movement range of the pump shaft
    

---

### üìè 4. **Final Selection**

Choose a coupling that:

- Transmits at least the **design torque**
    
- Fits **both shafts** (or is available with reducers)
    
- Accommodates the expected **misalignment**
    
- Allows enough **axial float** (floating bearing movement)
    

---

### üß∞ Tip: Safety and Installation

- **Proper alignment** during installation reduces coupling and bearing wear.
    
- Use **dial indicators or laser alignment tools** if high precision is needed.
    
- Check **mounting length** and **clearance** for axial movement.

Here is a link describes Flak Steelflex Grid couplings, one of the products my water treatment plant is considering to retrofit a shaft.

We need to choose a proper type and size of flexible coupling.

However, this is not an isolated issue. Our motor, a E-M Large Vertical Induction Motor suffers from vibration. This is likely due to the motor being oversized for the original concrete pile support. The Centrifugal raw sewage pump is the same, but the motor that drives it has been changed to this larger E-M, with a VFD, compared to the original version, which may have had a mag drive or direct drive.

Also, we are worried that a highly flexible coupling, included with vibration and misalignment, could cause the pump shaft to "flop".

# ChatGPT 1:
Thanks for the detailed background‚Äîthat‚Äôs critical for making a smart coupling choice. Based on what you've shared, here's a focused engineering breakdown:

---

## üß© Key Constraints from Your Setup

### 1. **Motor Upgrade Implications**

- The **oversized vertical E-M** on a possibly under-rated concrete pile is introducing **structural resonance or harmonic vibration**.
    
- **VFDs** often contribute additional **torsional pulsation** and **shaft current issues**.
    

### 2. **Pump-Side Weak Point**

- The **single spherical roller bearing** on the pump is **floating**‚Äîgreat for thermal expansion, but **poor at axial constraint** or resisting bending moments from misalignment or unbalanced loads.
    
- A **flexible coupling that transmits too much misalignment or shock** will cause **shaft deflection**, possibly leading to **rotor instability** or **"flopping"**.
    

---

## üîß Rexnord Falk Steelflex Grid Coupling Consideration

The **Steelflex Grid** is a **medium-flex** coupling designed to:

- Absorb shock and dampen vibration (good)
    
- Handle moderate misalignment (good)
    
- Transmit torque efficiently (good)
    
- Have **limited axial float** (can be a concern if axial movement is large)
    

üü° **Risk:** It‚Äôs more forgiving than a rigid coupling, but **still transfers some lateral and angular loads**. If your shaft alignment is imperfect and the pump bearing is sensitive, it may cause the rotor to deflect dynamically.

---

## ‚úÖ Engineering Recommendation

Given your situation, prioritize a coupling that:

- **Dampens torsional vibration** (from VFD + motor)
    
- **Minimizes radial and angular force transmission**
    
- **Allows axial float without pushing into pump**
    

### üîç Options Comparison:

|Coupling Type|Torsional Damping|Misalignment Tolerance|Axial Float|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Grid (like Steelflex)**|Medium|Moderate|Limited|Better than rigid, but still transmits some force|
|**Double-Disc**|Low|High (angular/axial)|High|Minimal torsional damping ‚Äî may transmit VFD ripple|
|**Elastomeric (Tire or Jaw)**|High|High|Moderate|Good damping, low force transmission|
|**Torsionally Soft Couplings (e.g. Falk Lifelign, Lovejoy S-Flex)**|Very High|High|High|Designed for vibration isolation ‚Äî good match|

---

## üß† Strategy for Your Retrofit

1. **Measure Actual Misalignment & Axial Float Range**
    
    - If you‚Äôre >0.5¬∞ angular or >0.5 mm radial misalignment, grid couplings may overburden the pump bearing.
        
2. **Conduct a Vibration Survey**
    
    - Confirm vibration source‚ÄîVFD drive train harmonics? Structural resonance? Motor imbalance?
        
    - Consider modal analysis of the motor/pile foundation.
        
3. **Consider Intermediate Shaft or Spacer**
    
    - A **spacer** with flexible coupling ends may **decouple vibration** and **protect the pump** from misaligned forces.
        
    - Helps isolate pump from axial loads due to thermal drift or misalignment.
        
4. **Try a Torsionally Soft, Axially Compliant Coupling First**
    
    - You might trial an elastomeric coupling with **good misalignment tolerance** and **torsional damping**.
        
    - Evaluate motor and pump side bearing loads post-install.

Would you like help comparing specific Rexnord or Lovejoy part numbers based on your motor torque and shaft sizes?

# Clayton 2:
We do not want to oversize our grid coupling, because it should serve as a mechanical fuse, so that neither shaft is damaged.

Please provide a roadmap for identifying a properly-rated coupling, based on torque and shaft input values. Provide modular equations, the high-level theory overview, and typical parlance and jargon necessary for shopping for properly-rated couplings.

# ChatGPT 2:
Excellent‚Äîtreating the coupling as a **mechanical fuse** is a smart, preventive design approach, especially when you have sensitive equipment like a pump with a floating bearing. Below is a **complete, structured roadmap** to help you **select and specify** a properly-rated flexible coupling‚Äîspecifically a _grid-type_ like the **Rexnord Falk Steelflex**‚Äîwithout oversizing it.

---

## üß† **High-Level Theory Overview**

A coupling must:

- **Transmit torque** between shafts
    
- **Accommodate misalignment** (angular, radial, axial)
    
- **Dampen vibration or shock**
    
- **Act as a fuse**: it should fail before damaging shafts or equipment
    

Oversizing a coupling reduces its compliance and may prevent it from failing under fault conditions‚Äîbad for fuse logic.

---

## üß∞ **Roadmap to Proper Coupling Sizing (Grid-Type)**

---

### üîπ **1. Gather Input Parameters**

|Parameter|Units|Description|
|---|---|---|
|PP|kW or HP|Power transmitted|
|NN|RPM|Shaft speed|
|DmD_m, DpD_p|mm or in|Motor and pump shaft diameters|
|SfS_f|‚Äî|Service factor (based on duty)|
|Application type|‚Äî|Steady, moderate shock, high shock|
|Misalignment limits|mm, degrees|Angular, radial, axial|
|Environment|‚Äî|Wet, chemical, temperature extremes|

---

### üîπ **2. Calculate Design Torque**

First, calculate **nominal torque**:

#### üßÆ Nominal Torque Equation

T=9550‚ãÖPNT = \frac{9550 \cdot P}{N}

Where:

- TT = Torque in **Nm**
    
- PP = Power in **kW**
    
- NN = Speed in **RPM**
    
- Use 63025 instead of 9550 if **power is in HP**
    

---

### üîπ **3. Apply Service Factor**

Account for dynamic loads using a **Service Factor (SF)**:

Tdesign=T‚ãÖSfT_{\text{design}} = T \cdot S_f

Typical **Service Factors (per AGMA / Rexnord):**

|Application Type|SF|
|---|---|
|Uniform (fans, blowers)|1.0‚Äì1.3|
|Moderate shock (pumps, conveyors)|1.4‚Äì1.6|
|Heavy shock (crushers, reciprocating machinery)|1.8‚Äì2.0|

üü® For your VFD + raw sewage pump setup, consider **S.F. = 1.5 to 1.75**

---

### üîπ **4. Match Coupling Based on Torque Rating**

Use the **manufacturer's coupling catalog** (e.g., Rexnord CP5-004) to:

- Identify a model that has a **rated torque ‚â•Tdesign\geq T_{\text{design}}**
    
- Make sure the **bore sizes** can accommodate both shaft diameters
    
- Ensure the **max misalignment** tolerances are compatible
    

**Avoid going too far above** TdesignT_{\text{design}}; this ensures it can still act as a **mechanical fuse**.

---

### üîπ **5. Confirm Misalignment and Axial Float**

Check:

- **Max angular misalignment** (¬∞)
    
- **Max parallel (radial) misalignment** (mm or in)
    
- **Max axial float** (mm or in)
    

üß≠ These values must cover real shaft movements **plus installation tolerances**.

---

### üîπ **6. Shaft Fit and Keying**

Verify:

- **Bore range**: Will the coupling fit your shaft diameters?
    
- **Keyway sizes** (match to shaft standard‚Äîe.g., ANSI or DIN)
    
- **Interference or clearance fit** needed for your operating conditions
    

You may need **bushed hubs** (e.g., Taper-Lock or QD style).

---

### üîπ **7. Check Environment and Safety Requirements**

Environmental conditions may require:

- **Stainless steel or epoxy coatings** (corrosion)
    
- **Dust covers or guards** (safety)
    
- **Non-lubricated variants** if **grease leakage is a concern**
    

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Terminology & Jargon When Sizing or Purchasing

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Torque Rating (Nm)**|Max continuous torque the coupling can transmit|
|**Peak Torque**|Max torque under fault or shock condition|
|**Service Factor (SF)**|Multiplier to account for non-uniform loads|
|**Bore Range**|Range of shaft diameters a coupling size can fit|
|**DBSE**|Distance Between Shaft Ends|
|**TIR** (Total Indicator Runout)|Used to check concentricity during alignment|
|**AGM/AISI/AGMA Ratings**|Design standards and material grades|
|**Torsional Compliance**|Coupling‚Äôs ability to twist and dampen shock|
|**Grid/Laminate/Disc**|Refers to coupling internal element design|

---

## üìä Sample Example

Let‚Äôs say:

- Power = 100 kW
    
- Speed = 1475 RPM
    
- SF = 1.5 (moderate shock, VFD, sewage)
    
- Shaft diameters = 90 mm (motor), 80 mm (pump)
    

**Step 1:**

T=9550‚ãÖ1001475=647.5‚ÄâNmT = \frac{9550 \cdot 100}{1475} = 647.5 \, \text{Nm}

**Step 2:**

Tdesign=647.5‚ãÖ1.5=971.3‚ÄâNmT_{\text{design}} = 647.5 \cdot 1.5 = 971.3 \, \text{Nm}

Now:

- Choose a grid coupling rated for **~1000 Nm**
    
- Make sure it fits 80 mm and 90 mm shafts (or order with specific bores)
    
- Confirm it handles expected misalignment and axial movement

**Note**: The T10 series offers a broader range of sizes and higher torque capacities compared to the T20 series. The choice between T10 and T20 often depends on installation orientation and maintenance preferences.

If you need assistance selecting the appropriate coupling size for your specific application, please provide details such as torque requirements, shaft sizes, and operational conditions.

# Clayton 5:
Which T10 or T20 sizes /models (1020T, 1030T, .... ,1250T, 1260T) might be appropriate for an induction motor of size 250 horsepower or larger?

# ChatGPT 5:
For an **induction motor of 250 horsepower (HP) or larger**, selecting an appropriate **Falk Steelflex Grid Coupling** (T10 or T20) involves matching **torque capacity** and **bore size** to the motor‚Äôs output and shaft dimensions. Here's how to narrow down the appropriate models:

---

### üîß Step 1: Estimate Motor Torque

Assume:

- **Motor HP**: 250 HP
    
- **Speed (N)**: 1,800 RPM (typical for 4-pole induction motors on 60 Hz)
    
- **Formula**:
    

Torque¬†(lb-in)=63025√óHPRPM=63025√ó2501800‚âà8753‚Äâlb-in\text{Torque (lb-in)} = \frac{63025 \times \text{HP}}{\text{RPM}} = \frac{63025 \times 250}{1800} \approx 8753 \, \text{lb-in}

Apply a **Service Factor (SF)** (e.g., 1.5‚Äì2.0) for shock loads, pump misalignment, or overloads:

Design¬†Torque‚âà8753√ó1.5=13,130‚Äâlb-in¬†(minimum)\text{Design Torque} \approx 8753 \times 1.5 = 13,130 \, \text{lb-in} \text{ (minimum)}

---

### üìò Step 2: Filter Suitable T10/T20 Sizes

Based on torque and bore capability:

|Model|Max Torque (lb-in)|Max Bore (in)|Comments|
|---|---|---|---|
|**1040T**|2,100 ‚Äì 2,800|~1.875"|Too small|
|**1050T**|3,850 ‚Äì 5,000|~2.125"|Borderline|
|**1060T**|6,050 ‚Äì 7,850|~2.625"|May work for smaller service factors|
|**1070T**|9,700 ‚Äì 12,600|~3.375"|‚úî Matches 250 HP with modest SF|
|**1080T**|15,800 ‚Äì 20,500|~3.875"|‚úî Solid for 250‚Äì400 HP range|
|**1090T**|24,300 ‚Äì 31,400|~4.375"|‚úî For higher service factor or larger HP|
|**1100T** and up|38,000+|5"+|For 500 HP+ or severe-duty setups|

---

### üìê Bore Compatibility

Check your motor and pump shaft diameters. Most 250 HP motors use shaft diameters between **2.375" and 3.375"**, which aligns well with **1070T to 1090T** sizes.

---

### ‚úÖ Recommended Sizes for 250 HP+

Depending on service factor and shaft diameter:

- **Minimum suitable**: **1070T10** / **1070T20**
    
- **Typical**: **1080T10** / **1080T20**
    
- **Heavy-duty or high SF**: **1090T10** / **1090T20**

# Clayton 5:
Our Raw Sewage Shaft is made of 1045 steel and have a small bore of 5 inches on the motor side, a small bore of 5.5 inches on the pump side, and is stepped up to a large bore of 6.5 inches in the middle. We have the option of replacing this shaft or instead designing a custom solution that involves a flexible coupling.

Max bore was provided in the Step 2 table above - what about minimum bore? What determines max bore? Is it the physical size of the coupling? How is the coupling tightened and secured to the coupled shafts on each side?

Also, i misspoke before on the rating - it is 1200 hp or 1500 hp!

Test speeds are 350 rpm to 440 rpm.

# Clayton 6:
Perfect ‚Äî **that low operating speed (350‚Äì440 RPM)** is a critical and _very helpful_ detail. It shifts the coupling selection entirely. Here's why:

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Effect of Low Speed on Coupling Sizing**

Coupling selection is based on **torque, not just power**, and **lower RPM ‚Üí higher torque** for the same HP.

Let‚Äôs recalculate:

---

### üìå For 1500 HP @ 440 RPM:

Torque=63025√ó1500440‚âà215,789‚Äâlb-in\text{Torque} = \frac{63025 \times 1500}{440} \approx 215,789 \, \text{lb-in}

### üìå For 1500 HP @ 350 RPM:

Torque=63025√ó1500350‚âà270,107‚Äâlb-in\text{Torque} = \frac{63025 \times 1500}{350} \approx 270,107 \, \text{lb-in}

‚û°Ô∏è **Design torque (with SF = 2.0)**:

Design¬†Torque‚âà430,000‚Äì540,000‚Äâlb-in\text{Design Torque} \approx 430,000 ‚Äì 540,000 \, \text{lb-in}

### üß± Now Match That to Coupling Sizes

You are now **well into the upper range** of the Falk Steelflex line.

|Model|Max Torque (lb-in)|Max Bore (in)|
|---|---|---|
|**1120T10**|~225,000|~6.5"|
|**1130T10**|~400,000|~7.0"|
|**1140T10**|~700,000+|~8.0"|

- **1130T or 1140T** will comfortably accept bores in this range.
    
- You can also **order dissimilar bore hubs** ‚Äî e.g., 5.5" bore on pump side and 5" on motor side ‚Äî _with the same coupling sleeve in the middle._

### üõ†Ô∏è Practical Tips:

1. ‚úÖ **Ask Rexnord or supplier** for dual-bore hub compatibility for the 1130‚Äì1140T range.
    
2. ‚öñÔ∏è Ensure **grid size matches design torque**, not just bore size.
    
3. üìà At these torque levels, **consider dynamic balancing** and **careful shaft alignment procedures**, especially since your pump shaft has a **single spherical roller bearing** and could "flop" with too much misalignment or flex.
    
4. üß© You may still want the coupling to serve as a **mechanical fuse** ‚Äî so **avoid over-sizing beyond your design torque** unless alignment and load dynamics are very unpredictable.
