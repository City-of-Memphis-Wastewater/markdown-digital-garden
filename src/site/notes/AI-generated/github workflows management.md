# Clayton 0
what is  a normal strategy for managing the github workflows file?

# Chat GPT 0
Great question. Managing the `.github/workflows/` directory is an important part of modern DevOps for Python/CLI projects ‚Äî especially with automation like CI, testing, linting, PyPI deploys, etc.

Here‚Äôs how most teams handle it, and what might make sense for you with `mulch`.

---

## üß± Normal Strategy for Managing `.github/workflows`

### ‚úÖ **1. Track It in Git and Push It to GitHub**

This is the **most common approach**.

- Workflows **live in the repo** at `.github/workflows/*.yml`
    
- Changes are tracked with Git like any other file
    
- Commits to workflows are reviewed just like code
    
- GitHub automatically picks them up on push to `main`, `dev`, etc.
    

üîÅ **Common Workflow:**

- Create a new workflow `.yml` file
    
- Test on a `dev` branch
    
- Merge to `main`
    
- GitHub runs it automatically
    

**Example files:**

```plaintext
.github/workflows/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ci.yml              # tests, linters, coverage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ release.yml         # builds, tags, deploys
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs.yml            # optional GH Pages build
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **2. Avoid Tracking Workflows (Uncommon)**

You're currently doing something unusual: holding `.github/workflows/` **locally** without tracking it in Git. This is fine for personal experimentation or if workflows are managed elsewhere (e.g. through a shared corporate template system or secrets policy), but:

- It breaks GitHub Actions integration unless files are actually in the repo
    
- Teammates (or automation) won‚Äôt see them
    
- Risk of inconsistency and drift
    
- Requires extra Git config (like `--assume-unchanged` or `.gitignore` hacks)
    

üëé This is generally discouraged unless you have a **very specific** reason to do it.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Strategy for You

Since `mulch` is a **CLI tool under active development**, and you're managing releases with care:

### ‚úîÔ∏è Track `.github/workflows/` in Git

1. **Create a simple CI pipeline**, e.g. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
    

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, dev]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - name: Install Poetry
        run: pip install poetry
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: poetry install
      - name: Run tests
        run: poetry run pytest
```

2. **Track it normally in Git**:
    

```bash
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "Add CI workflow"
git push
```

3. Optionally:
    
    - Add `release.yml` to automate publishing to PyPI on `tag` or `push`
        
    - Add `test.yml` for multi-platform builds or linting
        

---

## üß™ Optional: Use a Template/Scaffold Tool

If you want to avoid copy-pasting workflow files across projects, use:

- [`cookiecutter`](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) for project bootstrapping
    
- Or include your workflows in `mulch` scaffolding:
    
    ```json
    {
      ".github/workflows/ci.yml": "template content here"
    }
    ```
    

You could even build a `mulch init --github-actions` flag that installs your standard GitHub Actions suite automatically.

## üîë Summary

|Strategy|Recommended?|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Track `.github/workflows/` in Git|‚úÖ Yes|Most common, clean, visible to GitHub|
|Keep workflows local only|‚ùå No|Fragile, invisible to GitHub, bad for teams|
|Use templating (`mulch`, etc.)|‚úÖ Optional|Great for reusability|

Let me know if you want help writing a `ci.yml` for `poetry`, or automating PyPI releases using GitHub Actions.
