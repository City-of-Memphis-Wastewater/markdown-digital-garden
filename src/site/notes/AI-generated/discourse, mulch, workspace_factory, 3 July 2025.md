# Clayton 0:

there has been a key change: src/{projectname}/projectmanager.py has been changed to src/workpace_manager.py

the name of the tool is now mulch, as in pipx install mulch

mulch is currently incomplete (due to a session limit with ChatGPT, the intent got confused and now I am sorting out problems caused by that confusion)

there is a distincation between workspace_manager (a product generated by mulch) and workspace_factory (the portion of the mulch code that generates new workspaces and initilized new projects which include root/src/{projectname}/workspace_manager and root/workspaces/default and root/workspaces/{new}, etc)

a key problem is that my scaffold.json works to generate empty files but does not fill them

also, i need to generate the root/src/{projectname}/workspace_manager.py files, possibly based on jinja 2 templating

my thought is that ```mulch init``` will run phase one, to merely establish things which are constant, like the root/workspaces/ folder and the root/src folder, and also to generate an example default root/scaffold.json file

the scaffold.json file can then be edited to specify what the default workspace will be like and this will also be reflected in the successfuly templated root/src/{projectname}/workspace_manager.py file,  

clearer than mud? ask clarifying questions, one at a time

# ChatGPT 0:

Crystalizing beautifully. Let me confirm what I think you’re saying before we proceed:

> ❓ **First Clarification Question:**  
> When you say that `scaffold.json` currently "works to generate empty files but does not fill them," do you mean that:

- `mulch` is **creating the correct file paths**,
    
- but **not writing templated content** into those files?
    

Or do you mean that:

- it’s not even resolving the Jinja2 template with values from `scaffold.json`?
    

(Just want to pin down whether it’s a templating issue or a file-writing issue.)

# Clayton 1:

the first one

the code base does not currently support filling files

it is not using jinja2 yet

this is a function from the current (incomplete) version of mulch/src/mulch/workspace_factory.py

```
def load_scaffold(self) -> dict: 
        scaffold_path = Path(__file__).parent / self.DEFAULT_SCAFFOLD_FILENAME
        
        #fallback_scaffold = {
        #    "folders": ["workspaces", "logs", "configs"],
        #    "files": ["README.md", "default-workspace.toml"]
        #}
        
        fallback_scaffold = {
            "": ["config", "data", "imports", "exports", "scripts", "secrets", "queries"],
            "exports": ["aggregate"],
            "config": ["default-workspace.toml"],
            "secrets": ["secrets.yaml", "secrets-example.yaml"],
            "queries": ["default-queries.toml"]
        }
        
        if not scaffold_path.exists():
            # File missing, log warning and return fallback
            print(f"Warning: Missing scaffold file: {scaffold_path}, using fallback scaffold.")
            return fallback_scaffold
            
        #with open(scaffold_path, "r") as f:
        #    return json.load(f)
            
        try:
            with open(scaffold_path, "r") as f:
                content = f.read().strip()
                if not content:
                    print(f"Warning: Scaffold file {scaffold_path} is empty, using fallback scaffold.")
                    return fallback_scaffold
                return json.loads(content)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            print(f"Warning: Scaffold file {scaffold_path} contains invalid JSON ({e}), using fallback scaffold.")
            return fallback_scaffold

```


this is the current state of mulch/src/mulch/cli.py (which is wrong)

```
import typer
from pathlib import Path

    typer.echo(f"Workspace '{name}' initialized at {wm.workspace_dir}")

# ChatGPT 1:

Perfect. That clears it up. Here's the situation as I understand it, broken down surgically:

---

### ✅ What _is_ working:

- You have a CLI command (`mulch init`) that:
    
    - Creates a target workspace folder structure (via `WorkspaceFactory.check_and_create_dirs_from_scaffold()`).
        
    - Accepts a `--name` to define the workspace directory name.
        
    - Creates a default TOML file pointing to that workspace.
        
- `scaffold.json` defines the nested folder and file structure.
    
- You fall back to a hardcoded dict if `scaffold.json` is missing or invalid.
    

---

### 🚫 What is _not_ working yet:

- **Files listed in `scaffold.json` are created empty**, with no content.
    
- You’re not using **Jinja2** (or any templating engine) to generate the contents of files like `workspace_manager.py`.
    
- `workspace_manager.py` is not generated at all yet.
    
- `scaffold.json` is not used to **inject any content** into files.
    

---

## 🧭 Next Logical Step

You need to:

1. Add **support for file templating** (e.g., using Jinja2).
    
2. Define one or more template files (`workspace_manager.py.j2`, etc.)
    
3. Inject values from `scaffold.json` into those templates.
    
4. Write the rendered content to the proper location (`src/<workspace_name>/workspace_manager.py`)
    

---

### ❓My Next Clarifying Question:

> Do you want to treat `scaffold.json` as:

- **a layout spec only** (just folders + filenames, maybe a few config values),  
    **or**
    
- **a data context for template rendering** (values like `workspace_name`, dir names, defaults)  
    that gets passed into Jinja templates?
    

---

Clarifying this will help determine:

- Whether you use `scaffold.json` to _just_ define what gets made,
    
- Or whether you load it as a **context** into Jinja when rendering the `workspace_manager.py` file.

# Clayton 2:

Well, let's talk about which existing tools I might use to accomplish my goal, or to wrap mulch around

cookiecutter is a good candidate

is cookiecutter able to create variable numbers of folders based on the stub? or is it stuck with a particular format and all that changes is the names?

in comparison, tell me about jinja2 and what i can do with it and how it works

# ChatGPT 2:

Excellent topic. Understanding the boundaries between **Cookiecutter**, **Jinja2**, and your own logic (e.g., `mulch`) will help you choose the right tool for the right layer. Let’s break them down clearly:

---

## 🧁 **Cookiecutter**: Full Project Scaffolder

### ✅ What Cookiecutter _is_:

- A **wrapper** around **Jinja2** that scaffolds entire directory structures and files.
    
- It uses a folder-based **template project**, and a `cookiecutter.json` (or `.yaml`) to ask questions or accept values to fill into Jinja templates.
    
- It supports templating of **file contents**, **filenames**, **folder names**, etc.
    

### ✅ What it _can do_:

- Create **multiple folders/files**, conditionally, using Jinja2 logic (e.g., loops, conditionals).
    
- Create **dynamic paths and nested folders**, as long as the logic is handled inside the template.
    
- Run **post-hooks** (Python scripts or shell) after generation.
    
- Be used **programmatically** (`cookiecutter(...)`) or via CLI (`cookiecutter ./template`).
    

### 🚫 What it _can’t do easily_:

- Take a complex config like your `scaffold.json` and dynamically interpret an _arbitrary_ number of folders/files unless you pre-bake that logic into the template structure.
    
- React to runtime logic in Python unless you build that into post-generation hooks.
    

> **Verdict**: Cookiecutter is great for "create a new repo with a pre-defined structure and templated code"  
> But it’s not meant to be an engine that ingests a config file and generates N folders/files based on that.

---

## 🧩 **Jinja2**: Templating Engine Only

### ✅ What Jinja2 _is_:

- A **Python string rendering engine**, used to convert a template (`.j2` file) into a real file by injecting a `context` dictionary.
    
- The logic behind Cookiecutter (and Flask templates, Ansible, etc.)
    

### ✅ What it _can do_:

- Render text files, including `.py`, `.json`, `.toml`, etc.
    
- Run **logic in templates**: if/else, for-loops, filters (`capitalize`, `lower`, etc.)
    
- Dynamically generate code with injected values.
    

Example:

```jinja
# workspace_manager.py.j2
class WorkspaceManager:
    WORKSPACE_NAME = "{{ workspace_name }}"
    {% for folder in folders %}
    {{ folder.upper() }}_DIR = Path("{{ folder }}")
    {% endfor %}
```

With context:

```python
context = {
  "workspace_name": "eds_to_rjn",
  "folders": ["config", "exports", "queries"]
}
```

The output is a fully rendered Python file.

> **Verdict**: Jinja2 is perfect for **dynamically generating files** like `workspace_manager.py` from a structured config like `scaffold.json`.

---

## 🛠️ So What Should Mulch Do?

Given your structure and goals:

- Use **Jinja2** directly to:
    
    - Load `scaffold.json` as a dict
        
    - Use it as the **context**
        
    - Render `workspace_manager.py` into `src/<name>/workspace_manager.py`
        
- You can still offer optional **Cookiecutter-style scaffolding** for full projects (e.g., creating README.md, pyproject.toml, etc.), but that should be **a plugin or alternate path**, not your core.
    

---

## 🧠 Decision Summary

|Tool|Role in `mulch`|Strength|
|---|---|---|
|`Jinja2`|Core file generator|Generate `workspace_manager.py`, TOML, etc.|
|`scaffold.json`|User-supplied layout + context|Controls which folders and data to include|
|`mulch` CLI|Driver of everything|Calls Jinja2 with config, builds tree|
|`cookiecutter` (optional)|Full project scaffolding|Use if you want to offer repo templates|

---

## ✅ Ready for Action?

If you agree with this model, the next logical step is:

> **Integrate Jinja2 into `mulch` so that `workspace_manager.py.j2` can be rendered using `scaffold.json`.**

I can help you set up:

- A `templates/` folder
    
- A first `workspace_manager.py.j2`
    
- A `render_template()` function inside `WorkspaceFactory` or a new `TemplateRenderer` class
    

Ready to proceed? Or want to add your own thoughts first?

```

Note that eds_to_termux is empty. If we succeed, we could use mulch to set up that workspace directory to have the necessary file structure reflected in the workspace_manager.py file (currently projectmanager.py, pasted above).

note the relationship between the eds_to_rjn directory contents and the patterns in the projectmanager.json file. I need a way to drive those patterns, possibly using scaffold.json, stubs, jinja2, or something else.

also note that projectmanager.py already has a check_and_create_dirs() function, though it does not build the files such as secrets.yaml or secrets-example.yaml. these example files could be baked in and copied into the mulch cli tool

# ChatGPT 3:

Great breakdown—this is exactly the level of specificity that lets you engineer the right system.

---

## 🧠 Is `scaffold.json` a good choice for driving templating?

### ✅ Yes, **with minor expansion**, it can work really well.

Right now your `scaffold.json` behaves like a _folder map_, which is perfect for `check_and_create_dirs()`. But if you want to **drive generation of `workspace_manager.py`**, you’ll need to expand its role from just a filesystem map into a **templating context object**.

---

## ✨ What You Need It to Do:

You want `scaffold.json` to:

1. Define the **folder names** (as it already does).
    
2. Define the **filenames to generate** inside those folders.
    
3. Act as a source of config for injecting constants into `workspace_manager.py`:
    
    - Dir names → class attributes
        
    - Default file names → method logic (e.g. `SECRETS_YAML_FILE_NAME = "secrets.yaml"`)
        

---

## 🧱 Suggested `scaffold.json` Format

Here’s a version that supports both your current behavior **and** can power Jinja2:

```json
{
  "workspace_name": "eds_to_termux",
  "directories": {
    "": ["config", "data", "imports", "exports", "scripts", "secrets", "queries"],
    "exports": ["aggregate"]
  },
  "files": {
    "config": ["default-workspace.toml"],
    "secrets": ["secrets.yaml", "secrets-example.yaml"],
    "queries": ["default-queries.toml"]
  },
  "constants": {
    "DEFAULT_PROJECT_TOML_FILE_NAME": "default-project.toml",
    "TIMESTAMPS_JSON_FILE_NAME": "timestamps_success.json"
  }
}
```

Then you can pass this entire dictionary to Jinja2 as the context:

```python
template.render(**scaffold_data)
```

And in `workspace_manager.py.j2`:

```jinja
class WorkspaceManager:
    {% for const, val in constants.items() %}
    {{ const }} = "{{ val }}"
    {% endfor %}

    {% for folder in directories[""] %}
    {{ folder.upper() }}_DIR_NAME = "{{ folder }}"
    {% endfor %}
```

You can even use it to drive `check_and_create_dirs()` logic inside the class.

---

## 🧩 Relationship to Current Structure

- The structure of `eds_to_rjn/` clearly maps to the `directories` field.
    
- The files (`secrets.yaml`, etc.) are declared in `files`, and `mulch` can copy those from a built-in `/templates/examples/` directory using `shutil.copy(...)`.
    

---

## ✅ So, yes — `scaffold.json` is a good tool

...**as long as you treat it like structured input** for both:

- directory scaffolding (phase 1), and
    
- Jinja2 templating (phase 2)
    

And once the file includes both layout and value declarations, `workspace_manager.py.j2` becomes incredibly flexible.

---

Would you like help writing the first version of that `.j2` template file, or the function to render and write it?
# Clayton 4:

i presume that your scaffold.json file looks nice, though i dont think it should include "workspace_name": "eds_to_termux",, because this scaffold file in root will be used to drive the creation of all new workspaces

the workspacemanager.py file only needs to be generated once, but each new workspace in workspaces/ needs to use the necessary file structre

with this in mind, maybe the mulch tool should be used to just generate the workspace_manager.py file, and then in turn that code can be used to generate new workspaces based on its own baked in structure

also, this all presumes that I will want different scaffolds each time, but it is possible / likely I will want to reuse the same scaffold for most of my projects and perform necessary tweaks manually. Maybe we should stick with cookiecutter for now, and set up a good scaffold git repo
	
# ChatGPT 4:

That’s a wise move. Your clarification reveals two core realities:

---

## ✅ Refined Architecture Insight

### 🌱 1. `scaffold.json` lives at the **root**, and defines a reusable _default scaffold_ for all future workspaces

- It does **not** belong to any one workspace (`eds_to_termux`, `eds_to_rjn`, etc.).
    
- So yes—remove `"workspace_name"` from the JSON.
    

---

### 🏗️ 2. `workspace_manager.py` is a **once-per-repo product**, not per-workspace

- It is generated _once_ into `src/<project_name>/workspace_manager.py`.
    
- Its baked-in constants and directory logic will then **manage** new workspaces (under `workspaces/`) at runtime.
    
- The CLI (`mulch init`) doesn't _create_ the workspaces directly—it uses the `WorkspaceManager` class to do that. This decouples the tooling from the logic.
    

---

### 🌀 3. Most of your projects will share a common scaffold (for now)

- So it **makes sense to start by versioning a canonical scaffold** in a Git repo.
    
- Then you can wrap that in **Cookiecutter**, or simply copy it in `mulch` phase 1.
    
- If your scaffold evolves, you can still modify the `workspace_manager.py` template and re-roll it later.
    

---

## ✅ So, your revised system could look like this:

### Phase 1: Use `mulch` to bootstrap a repo

- Output:
    
    - `workspaces/` directory
        
    - `src/<project_name>/workspace_manager.py` (from Jinja2 template)
        
    - `scaffold.json` (copied or symlinked from repo)
        

### Phase 2: At runtime, use `WorkspaceManager` to:

- Generate folders under `workspaces/<name>` according to its built-in rules
    
- Optionally copy over stub files (e.g. `secrets.yaml`, etc.)
    

---

## ✅ What's Next

Here’s what I recommend:

1. ✅ **Keep `scaffold.json` simple and universal**  
    You already have the right structure for it:
    
    ```json
    {
      "": ["config", "data", "imports", "exports", "scripts", "secrets", "queries"],
      "exports": ["aggregate"],
      "config": ["default-workspace.toml"],
      "secrets": ["secrets.yaml", "secrets-example.yaml"],
      "queries": ["default-queries.toml"]
    }
    ```
    
2. ✅ **Create a `workspace_manager.py.j2` template**  
    It will embed the above structure as attributes/methods.
    
3. ✅ **Write a `render_template()` function inside mulch**  
    Use `jinja2` to render the file using `scaffold.json`.
    
4. ✅ **Create a `scaffold-template` Git repo**  
    Let it contain:
    
    - `scaffold.json`
        
    - `workspace_manager.py.j2`
        
    - Optional stub files like `secrets-example.yaml`
        
5. ✅ **Later, you can decide to wrap this repo with Cookiecutter if desired.**  
    This will allow command-line generation of _whole repo templates_, but for now, a `mulch init` command that copies and renders files is enough.

Would you like me to help generate a starter `workspace_manager.py.j2` file now, based on your real implementation and the scaffold data structure?
# Clayton 5:

leveraging a github repo will make it easier to fill / copy important workspace files like secrets-example.yaml, default-workspace.toml (aka default-project.toml), default-query.toml, etc, right?

down the line (take this with a grain of salt) it might be reasonable to:

1. Use github / jinja2 / cookiecutter / mulch to standup new code directories, using the most feature rich possible version

2. edit the scaffold file and/or interact with a CLI to remove unecesary components

3. submit these changes so that unnecessary compnents are removed (like if the package does not need queries or secrets, for example)

Let me clarify that files like secrets-example.yaml, default-workspace.toml, default-queries.toml are meant to control values for each workspace. each piece of python software that leverages a version workspace_manager can have multiple workspaces, each with different values in these files. while these files might be used as a standard across pieces of software I write, they by no means need to maintain the same internal values.

# ChatGPT 5:

Yes—you're thinking clearly, and you're laying the groundwork for a robust and flexible system. Let’s break this down and clarify where GitHub, Jinja2, Cookiecutter, and your own tooling (`mulch`) can be leveraged effectively.

---

## ✅ Why GitHub Is a Smart Move

Using a **GitHub-based template repo** gives you:

- ✅ **Version control** over template files (like `secrets-example.yaml`, `default-workspace.toml`, etc.)
    
- ✅ A canonical source for updates or changes to standard scaffolds
    
- ✅ A way to clone or include those templates directly during `mulch init` or `cookiecutter` invocation
    

You can organize it like:

```
workspace-template/
├── scaffold.json
├── templates/
│   ├── workspace_manager.py.j2
│   └── stub_files/
│       ├── secrets-example.yaml
│       ├── default-workspace.toml
│       └── default-queries.toml
```

---

## 🧩 Clarifying Template Use and Runtime Behavior

You’re absolutely right to draw a line between:

|Purpose|Files/Templates|Created by|Used by|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Bootstrapping a repo**|`workspace_manager.py`, `scaffold.json`, stub `*.toml/yaml`|`mulch init`, `cookiecutter`, or both|Developers|
|**Defining workspace-specific values**|`secrets.yaml`, `default-workspace.toml`, `default-queries.toml`|Runtime logic via `workspace_manager.py`|Each workspace|

Each of your Python projects uses the same **logic** (`workspace_manager.py`) to parse and handle these per-workspace files—but the **values inside** them will vary **per workspace**. That means the stub values are just starting points.

---

## 🔁 Future Workflow Vision (and it’s realistic)

Here’s your "maybe down the line" workflow—refined into a clear lifecycle:

### Phase 1: Initialize using richest default template

- `mulch init --name myproject`
    
- Pulls scaffold and templates from GitHub (or local cache)
    
- Outputs:
    
    - `src/myproject/workspace_manager.py`
        
    - `scaffold.json`
        
    - `workspaces/default/` with stub files
        

### Phase 2: Tweak scaffold file or edit project manually

- Remove `"queries"` from scaffold if not needed
    
- Optionally run a CLI wizard:
    
    ```bash
    mulch customize
    # [x] Keep 'secrets'
    # [ ] Remove 'queries'
    # [x] Keep 'exports'
    ```
    

### Phase 3: Re-render

- Mulch regenerates or trims `workspace_manager.py`
    
- Deletes removed dirs/files (optional interactive confirmation)
    

### Phase 4: Lock in the new form

- Git commit the final setup

## 🟡 Where You're Headed

You're designing `mulch` as a **hybrid** tool:

- It **wraps lower-level tools like Jinja2 and Cookiecutter**
    
- It also **adds lifecycle management** of workspaces based on runtime logic (`workspace_manager.py`)
    
- It avoids tight coupling with Cookiecutter templates—_you can use them, but don’t depend on them exclusively_
    

---

## ✅ Summary: You’re on the Right Track

- Yes, GitHub-based scaffolds make filling/stubbing workspace files easier and cleaner.
    
- Each workspace gets a _copy_ of stub files whose internal values are **workspace-specific**.
    
- The master templating logic lives in `workspace_manager.py.j2`, powered by `scaffold.json`.
    
- Cookiecutter can be part of this, but **`mulch` remains your glue** for long-term customization.

Would you like a draft repo structure or `workspace_manager.py.j2` next?
# Clayton 6:

I think you might be off track

I think you might be conflating the organization of the mulch tool with the organization of my python projects.

i dont think my python projects need a templates folder, but you can convince me otherwise

# ChatGPT 6:

You’re right to pause here. Let’s reset with a hard boundary between:

- 🔧 **`mulch`** (the CLI tool you’re building)
    
- 🧠 **Your Python projects** (which are managed using a `workspace_manager.py` and a `workspaces/` folder)
    

You're _not_ off track—your instinct is correct.

---

## 🔧 `mulch`: a **tool**

This lives on its own. You install it via `pipx install mulch`, and it:

- Bootstraps a repo (sets up `workspace_manager.py`, `scaffold.json`, `workspaces/`)
    
- Optionally copies over stub files
    
- Optionally uses Jinja2 templates to render content
    

📁 Structure of **`mulch`** (itself, as a tool):

```
mulch/
├── src/
│   └── mulch/
│       ├── cli.py
│       ├── workspace_factory.py
│       ├── templates/                  <--- yes, this makes sense here
│       │   ├── workspace_manager.py.j2
│       │   └── stub_files/
│       │       ├── secrets-example.yaml
│       │       └── default-workspace.toml
│       └── ...
├── scaffold.json                       <--- optional fallback default
```

👉 The `templates/` folder belongs to **`mulch`**, not to your downstream Python projects.

---

## 🧠 Your Python Projects: No templates folder needed

When `mulch init` is run inside a _user’s repo_, it might generate:

```
myproject/
├── workspaces/
│   └── default/
│       ├── config/
│       │   └── default-workspace.toml
│       ├── secrets/
│       │   ├── secrets-example.yaml
│       │   └── secrets.yaml   (optional copy)
│       ├── queries/
│       │   └── default-queries.toml
│       └── ...
├── src/
│   └── myproject/
│       └── workspace_manager.py       <-- rendered from jinja2 template
├── scaffold.json                      <-- defines what gets generated
```

🔁 But the downstream **Python project does _not_ include a `templates/` folder**. All rendering and templating happens inside the mulch engine.

---

## ✅ Your Intuition Is Correct

- The **`templates/` folder belongs to `mulch`**, not to your actual projects.
    
- Your projects only contain the _result_ of template rendering.
    
- The user shouldn’t even need to know how it was rendered unless they’re modifying mulch itself.
    

---

### TL;DR

You don’t need `templates/` in your Python projects.  
Only `mulch` (as a CLI tool) needs them.

Would you like a clean `mulch/templates/workspace_manager.py.j2` file next? Or an overview of how `mulch` renders it based on `scaffold.json`?
# Clayton 7:

okay, good review. Your prjoect structure is close, but there is a mistake. default-workspace.toml is meant to live inside the workspaces/ directory, so that on start up is can point to which workspace to use

like this

myproject/
├── workspaces/
│   └── default-workspace.toml
│   └── default/
│       ├── config/
│       │    
│       ├── secrets/
│       │   ├── secrets-example.yaml
│       │   └── secrets.yaml   (optional copy)
│       ├── queries/
│       │   └── default-queries.toml
│       └──  
├── src/
│   └── myproject/
│       └── workspace_manager.py       <-- rendered from jinja2 template
├── scaffold.json                      <-- defines what gets generated


and the content of default-workspace.toml is
```
[default-workspace]
workspace = "eds_to_rjn"
use-most-recently-edited-workspace-directory = false
```


# ChatGPT 7:

Crystal clear now — thanks for that correction. Here's the updated and accurate structure of a **downstream Python project** that uses `mulch` to manage workspaces:

---

## ✅ Corrected Project Structure

```
myproject/
├── workspaces/
│   ├── default-workspace.toml         <-- points to active workspace
│   └── eds_to_rjn/                    <-- one actual workspace
│       ├── config/
│       │   └── ...
│       ├── secrets/
│       │   ├── secrets-example.yaml
│       │   └── secrets.yaml
│       ├── queries/
│       │   └── default-queries.toml
│       ├── exports/
│       │   └── aggregate/
│       ├── imports/
│       ├── scripts/
│       └── ...
├── src/
│   └── myproject/
│       └── workspace_manager.py       <-- rendered once from Jinja2 template
├── scaffold.json                      <-- editable to define workspace layout
```

---

## 📌 `default-workspace.toml` Example

```toml
[default-workspace]
workspace = "eds_to_rjn"
use-most-recently-edited-workspace-directory = false
```

This lives in `workspaces/` (not inside any workspace), so the `workspace_manager.py` logic can reliably locate it and use it to decide which workspace folder (like `eds_to_rjn/`) to activate at runtime.

---

## 🧠 Summary of Roles

|Component|Role|
|---|---|
|`mulch` (CLI tool)|Bootstraps the project and renders `workspace_manager.py`|
|`workspace_manager.py`|Runtime logic to read `default-workspace.toml`, resolve paths, etc.|
|`default-workspace.toml`|Switcher: tells the system which workspace is active|
|`scaffold.json`|Defines folders/files for new workspaces (`config`, `secrets`, etc.)|
|`workspaces/<name>/...`|Real isolated runtime contexts (data, config, secrets, etc.)|

---

Would you like me to now help:

1. Generate the `workspace_manager.py.j2` Jinja template?
    
2. Build logic in `mulch` to fill files using Jinja and `scaffold.json`?
    
3. Create a separate GitHub repo for your default scaffold structure?
    

Or something else?

i think i want to use a loaded scaffold.json  dictionary on an input.

how can i expose it when using the mulch library?

# Chat GPT 8:

Great question. Since you're trying to use the `mulch` library **programmatically** (e.g., `import mulch` and call something like `mulch.load_scaffold()`), you need to:

---

## ✅ 1. Expose the Function in `__init__.py`

In your `mulch/__init__.py`, you can expose specific utilities from deeper modules. For example:

```python
# mulch/__init__.py

from .workspace_factory import WorkspaceFactory, load_scaffold

__all__ = ["WorkspaceFactory", "load_scaffold"]
```

---

## ✅ 2. Define the Scaffold Loader as a Callable

Make sure `load_scaffold()` is a function you can call directly. If it’s currently a method on a class, and you want it as a standalone tool, refactor like this:

```python
# mulch/workspace_factory.py

import json
from pathlib import Path

DEFAULT_SCAFFOLD_FILENAME = "scaffold.json"

def load_scaffold(scaffold_path: Path | None = None) -> dict:
    fallback_scaffold = {
        "": ["config", "data", "imports", "exports", "scripts", "secrets", "queries"],
        "exports": ["aggregate"],
        "config": ["default-workspace.toml"],
        "secrets": ["secrets.yaml", "secrets-example.yaml"],
        "queries": ["default-queries.toml"]
    }

    if scaffold_path is None:
        scaffold_path = Path(__file__).parent / DEFAULT_SCAFFOLD_FILENAME

    if not scaffold_path.exists():
        print(f"Warning: Missing scaffold file: {scaffold_path}, using fallback scaffold.")
        return fallback_scaffold

    try:
        content = scaffold_path.read_text().strip()
        if not content:
            print(f"Warning: Scaffold file {scaffold_path} is empty, using fallback scaffold.")
            return fallback_scaffold
        return json.loads(content)
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Warning: Scaffold file {scaffold_path} contains invalid JSON ({e}), using fallback scaffold.")
        return fallback_scaffold
```

---

## ✅ 3. Use it Like This

Now from Python:

```python
>>> import mulch
>>> scaffold = mulch.load_scaffold()
>>> scaffold['secrets']
['secrets.yaml', 'secrets-example.yaml']
```

Or with a custom file:

```python
>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> mulch.load_scaffold(Path("my/custom_scaffold.json"))
```

---

## Bonus: If You Want a CLI Hook

Add a command like this to `mulch/cli.py`:

```python
@app.command()
def show_scaffold(path: Optional[Path] = None):
    """Print the scaffold structure."""
    from .workspace_factory import load_scaffold
    scaffold = load_scaffold(path)
    typer.echo(json.dumps(scaffold, indent=2))
```

Then run:

```bash
poetry run mulch show-scaffold
```

Would you like help turning the `load_scaffold()` data into a file generator next?
