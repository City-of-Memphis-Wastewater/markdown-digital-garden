# Query 0:
I have a ProjectManager class, for directory management

I also have a function, in calls.py, called get_points_live(), to get the value and timestamp for live sensor values

I need to store the live values and timestamps, to a JSON file, every five minutes

I also have an ingestion.py file, to be run every hour, for taking the stored data from the live queries, packaging it into 12 values per sensor, generating a final export JSON

From there, I need to call a third party api, each hour, and POST the aggregate data

# Chat GPT 0:
Sounds like you've got a well-structured data pipeline in place! Here's how you could design and connect the parts together, based on your needs:

---

### üß± Your Components So Far

1. **`ProjectManager`**: Handles paths and directory structure.
    
2. **`get_points_live()` in `calls.py`**: Grabs live values + timestamps.
    
3. **`ingestion.py`**: Aggregates 5-min interval JSONs into hourly summaries.
    
4. **Hourly POST to 3rd-party API**: Needs to happen after aggregation.
    

---

### ‚úÖ GOAL

- **Every 5 minutes**: Query live data ‚Üí Save to JSON
    
- **Every hour**: Read 12 x 5-min JSONs ‚Üí Aggregate ‚Üí Save ‚Üí POST to API
    

---

### üß© Step-by-Step Architecture

#### 1. **ProjectManager updates**

```python
from pathlib import Path
import datetime

class ProjectManager:
    def __init__(self, base_dir):
        self.base = Path(base_dir)
        self.data_dir = self.base / "data"
        self.live_dir = self.data_dir / "live_snapshots"
        self.export_dir = self.data_dir / "hourly_exports"
        self.live_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        self.export_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

    def get_live_snapshot_path(self, timestamp=None):
        ts = timestamp or datetime.datetime.utcnow()
        return self.live_dir / f"live_{ts.strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M')}.json"

    def get_hourly_export_path(self, timestamp=None):
        ts = timestamp or datetime.datetime.utcnow()
        return self.export_dir / f"export_{ts.strftime('%Y%m%d_%H')}.json"
```

---

#### 2. **Script for 5-minute Live Snapshot** (`snapshot.py`)

```python
import json
import datetime
from calls import get_points_live
from project_manager import ProjectManager

pm = ProjectManager("/path/to/rjn-clarity")
data = get_points_live()
timestamp = datetime.datetime.utcnow()

output = {
    "timestamp": timestamp.isoformat(),
    "data": data
}

with open(pm.get_live_snapshot_path(timestamp), "w") as f:
    json.dump(output, f, indent=2)
```

You can run this every 5 minutes with a `cron` job or `schedule` module.

---

#### 3. **Hourly Ingestion + API Push** (`ingestion.py`)

```python
import json
import datetime
from pathlib import Path
from project_manager import ProjectManager
import requests

pm = ProjectManager("/path/to/rjn-clarity")
now = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
hour_start = now.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

# Collect last 12 5-min snapshots
snapshots = []
for i in range(12):
    ts = hour_start - datetime.timedelta(minutes=5 * i)
    path = pm.get_live_snapshot_path(ts)
    if path.exists():
        with open(path) as f:
            snapshots.append(json.load(f))
snapshots.reverse()  # ensure chronological order

# Aggregate data by sensor
aggregated = {}
for snap in snapshots:
    for sensor, val in snap["data"].items():
        aggregated.setdefault(sensor, []).append(val)

final_export = {
    "timestamp": hour_start.isoformat(),
    "aggregated_data": aggregated
}

# Save export JSON
export_path = pm.get_hourly_export_path(hour_start)
with open(export_path, "w") as f:
    json.dump(final_export, f, indent=2)

# Post to 3rd-party API
response = requests.post("https://third-party.api/endpoint", json=final_export)
print(f"Posted to API, status code: {response.status_code}")
```

---

### üïí Scheduling

- Run `snapshot.py` every 5 minutes.
    
- Run `ingestion.py` every hour (at HH:00).
    

Use `cron`, `systemd`, or a `schedule` loop for local runs.

---

Would you like help generating the cron job setup, or a `main.py` that runs both tasks based on time with a scheduler?

# Query 1:
i have a windows system - i think i should leverage Task Schedule to call powershell on a clock, to launch the python code, if it is off.

Also the program can run continuously. Would this be computationally expensive, to call three sensor values every five minutes, and then to transmit them each hour?

# ChatGPT 1:
You're spot-on, George ‚Äî on **Windows**, you'd use **Task Scheduler** instead of cron. And you're absolutely right: you can use Task Scheduler to run a PowerShell script every 5 minutes or hourly to launch your Python code **only if needed**.

---

### ‚úÖ Answering Your Main Concern:

> Would this be computationally expensive?

**Nope, not at all.**

You're only:

- **Calling 3 sensor values** every 5 minutes
    
- **Writing a small JSON file**
    
- **Aggregating & posting** once per hour
    

This is **very lightweight**, especially if:

- You‚Äôre not querying a massive database
    
- The sensor query is via HTTP, Modbus, or a local API
    
- Your computer isn‚Äôt severely underpowered (like a Raspberry Pi Zero)
    

Even **continuously running a Python loop with `sleep()` and occasional I/O** would use **minimal CPU and memory** ‚Äî especially if the process is I/O-bound (waiting on sensor response or writing files).

---

### ‚úÖ Alternatives

You have two options:

#### A. **Scheduled Tasks with PowerShell**

Let Python quit after running.

- 5-min task ‚Üí `snapshot.py`
    
- 60-min task ‚Üí `ingestion.py`
    

Example PowerShell command:

```powershell
python "C:\path\to\rjn-clarity\snapshot.py"
```

Schedule that in Task Scheduler with:

- Trigger: Daily ‚Üí repeat every 5 minutes
    
- Action: Start a program ‚Üí PowerShell with `-Command` set as above
    

#### B. **Python Daemon That Runs All Day**

Write a loop that:

- Sleeps until the next 5-minute mark
    
- Runs `get_points_live()` and saves snapshot
    
- Once an hour (e.g., on minute == 0), runs the aggregation + POST
    

This gives you a **single running program** ‚Äî super clean if you‚Äôre deploying it on a local machine or VM and want log control.

---

### Want Help With Either?

- A sample PowerShell command + scheduler XML?
    
- Or a version of your app that runs as a loop with internal timers?
    

Let me know your preference and I‚Äôll build you the right setup.


# Query 2:
Let's go with the python daemon, that is operating system agnostic, so that it can ultimately be set up on a server.

I would also like powershell commands to check if the python daemon is running or not, and if it is not, to be able to start it.
# ChatGPT 2:
Perfect ‚Äî a Python daemon is a great way to make your system **cross-platform** and self-contained. Here's how we can structure it:

---

## üêç Python Daemon: `rjn_daemon.py`

This script runs indefinitely:

- Every 5 minutes: call `get_points_live()` and save a JSON
    
- Every hour (on the dot): aggregate and POST to API
    

### ‚úÖ `rjn_daemon.py` (basic version)

```python
import time
import datetime
from calls import get_points_live
from ingestion import run_hourly_ingestion
from project_manager import ProjectManager

pm = ProjectManager("/path/to/rjn-clarity")

def log(msg):
    print(f"[{datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()}] {msg}")

def run_daemon():
    last_hour = None
    while True:
        now = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
        minute = now.minute
        second = now.second

        # Every 5 min snapshot
        if minute % 5 == 0 and second < 5:
            log("Running 5-minute snapshot")
            snapshot = {
                "timestamp": now.isoformat(),
                "data": get_points_live()
            }
            with open(pm.get_live_snapshot_path(now), "w") as f:
                import json
                json.dump(snapshot, f, indent=2)

        # Hourly aggregation
        if now.minute == 0 and now.hour != last_hour:
            last_hour = now.hour
            log("Running hourly ingestion and API push")
            run_hourly_ingestion(pm)

        time.sleep(5)  # Check every 5 seconds
```

Make sure `ingestion.py` exposes a function like:

```python
def run_hourly_ingestion(pm: ProjectManager):
    # ... your ingestion logic from earlier ...
```

Then use:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_daemon()
```

---

## ü™ü PowerShell Utilities

### ‚úÖ 1. Check if `rjn_daemon.py` is running

```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Path -like "*rjn_daemon.py*" }
```

Or, if launched via `python.exe`:

```powershell
Get-Process python | Where-Object { $_.Path -like "*rjn_daemon.py*" -or $_.CommandLine -like "*rjn_daemon.py*" }
```

### ‚úÖ 2. Start the daemon if not running

```powershell
$daemonRunning = Get-Process python | Where-Object { $_.CommandLine -like "*rjn_daemon.py*" }

if (-not $daemonRunning) {
    Start-Process -NoNewWindow -FilePath "python.exe" -ArgumentList "C:\path\to\rjn-clarity\rjn_daemon.py"
    Write-Output "Daemon started."
} else {
    Write-Output "Daemon is already running."
}
```

You could save this check/start script as `check_daemon.ps1`.

---

## üí° Optional Enhancements

- Add a PID file or lock file for more robust daemon tracking.
    
- Log to a file with `logging` module.
    
- Consider graceful shutdown (e.g., catch Ctrl+C to clean up resources).
    
- Run it as a service (Windows: NSSM, Linux: systemd).
    

---

Want me to write a full `rjn_daemon.py` + `ingestion.py` with importable structure and logging?

# Query 3:
sure, show me what you've got, with rigorous comments and a clear jargon glossary, targeted for a person who has never set up a daemon.

The purpose of this daemon is to retrieve data from the EDS server(s) every five minutes, and then POST is to RJN.

I want the code to be modular, non-specific to these API's mentioned, to work with for yet-unknown API's down the line.

Using a name like RJNCaptureDaemon in the code would be overly specific. Make it agnostic.

Also leverage the existing ProjectManager class. Here is that code:

(paste, 8:05 AM, 25 April 2025, entire projectmanager.py)
# Chat GPT 3:
Here's your clean, modular, and extensible Python daemon framework ready to drop into your project. Key points:

---

## üîß How to Use This

1. **Implement your live query** as `retrieve_snapshot_data()` ‚Äî return a dictionary like:
    
    ```python
    {"sensor_1": {"value": 5.2, "unit": "mg/L"}, "sensor_2": {...}}
    ```
    
2. **Implement your ingestion logic** as `run_hourly_ingestion(pm)` ‚Äî e.g.:
    
    - Load past 12 JSON snapshots
        
    - Compile them into one
        
    - POST to an external API
        
3. **Run the daemon:**
    
    ```bash
    python rjn_daemon.py
    ```
    

---

## üß† Why This Design?

- üß© **Modular**: Works with any project and future APIs
    
- üïí **Time-based control**: 5-min and hourly triggers
    
- üßº **Clean separation**: ProjectManager handles paths, daemon handles timing, external code handles logic
    
- üìÅ **Portable**: No system dependencies ‚Äî cross-platform
    

---

If you'd like, I can build:

- Example snapshot data (mock sensor values)
    
- Ingestion logic that pulls the last 12 files
    
- API POST stub (with `requests`)
    

Want that next?

# Query 3:
Excellent, I like that you left the retrieve_snapshot_data() functions to be developed by me, based on the rest of my code base it might be appropriate to do a dynamic import , (at startup of the daemon, not continuously), from the active project directory. in 
```
projects/<project>/scripts
```
is where the main script lives for the current API hookup.

Is this poor design? 
```
# These should be implemented elsewhere in your project to stay modular 
def retrieve_snapshot_data() -> dict: 
	""" Return live data as a dictionary. 
	Should include timestamp and sensor data. """ 
	psuedocode:
	import script from current project, in the hypomain.py file at pm.get_scripts_dir() 
	raise NotImplementedError("You must implement retrieve_snapshot_data()")
```


# Chat GPT 3:
That's actually a **smart and flexible design** ‚Äî using a dynamic import from `projects/<project>/scripts/hypomain.py` makes the daemon reusable across multiple projects without hardcoding logic.

Here‚Äôs how you can cleanly and safely do it using `importlib`, so the daemon dynamically loads the correct hook at runtime:

---

### ‚úÖ Modify the Daemon Startup

Replace the hardcoded `retrieve_snapshot_data` function with a dynamic loader:

```python
import importlib.util
import os

def load_snapshot_hook(pm: ProjectManager) -> Callable[[], dict]:
    """
    Dynamically load retrieve_snapshot_data() from the project's hypomain.py script.
    """
    script_path = pm.get_scripts_file_path("hypomain.py")

    if not os.path.exists(script_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"No hypomain.py found at: {script_path}")

    spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("hypomain", script_path)
    module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
    spec.loader.exec_module(module)

    if not hasattr(module, "retrieve_snapshot_data"):
        raise AttributeError(f"'retrieve_snapshot_data()' not found in {script_path}")

    return getattr(module, "retrieve_snapshot_data")
```

### ‚úÖ Update your daemon‚Äôs `__main__` block:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    project_name = "eds_to_stantec_2025"
    pm = ProjectManager(project_name)

    snapshot_hook = load_snapshot_hook(pm)

    daemon = DataCaptureDaemon(
        project_manager=pm,
        snapshot_hook=snapshot_hook,
        hourly_hook=run_hourly_ingestion  # You can keep this modular too if you want
    )

    daemon.run()
```

---

### üß† Why this works well:

- ‚úÖ Keeps the daemon **generic**
    
- üîå Your per-project logic lives in `hypomain.py`, so **swapping projects = no daemon changes**
    
- üß™ Easy to test each piece independently
    
- üõ°Ô∏è Has error checking for missing files or functions
    

Let me know if you'd like to extend this pattern to `run_hourly_ingestion()` as well!

# Query 4:
Excellent

I want to make the __main__ block more modular by having it pull the project name from a toml file, called default_project.toml, which is found in the "projects" directory and can point to any of the project directories found there.

this is the toml structure i have chosen
```
[default project]
project = "eds_to_rjn"
```
i need to add functionality to the project manager class,

```
def identify_default_project(self):
	# look here for the toml file, default_project.toml
	self.get_projects_dir()

def get_projects_dir(self):
	return os.path.join(self.base_dir, 'projects')

def get_project_dir(self):
	#
	pass
```
# Chat GPT 4:
Perfect approach ‚Äî using a `default_project.toml` file to decouple hardcoded project names is clean and extensible. Let‚Äôs flesh this out by:

1. Adding TOML parsing to load the default project.
    
2. Adding `get_projects_dir()` and `get_project_dir()` methods to `ProjectManager`.
    
3. Updating your `__main__` logic to be driven by that TOML file.
    

---

### ‚úÖ Full `ProjectManager` Updates (Additions Only)

```python
import toml  # Requires `toml` or `tomli` for Python < 3.11

class ProjectManager:
    # ... existing methods ...

    def get_projects_dir(self):
        return os.path.join(self.base_dir, 'projects')

    def get_project_dir(self):
        return os.path.join(self.get_projects_dir(), self.project_name)

    @classmethod
    def identify_default_project(cls):
        """
        Class method that reads default_project.toml to identify the default project.
        """
        base_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)))
        projects_dir = os.path.join(base_dir, 'projects')
        default_toml_path = os.path.join(projects_dir, 'default_project.toml')

        if not os.path.exists(default_toml_path):
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"Missing default_project.toml in {projects_dir}")

        with open(default_toml_path, 'r') as f:
            config = toml.load(f)

        try:
            return config['default project']['project']
        except KeyError as e:
            raise KeyError(f"Missing key in default_project.toml: {e}")
```

---

### ‚úÖ Example `default_project.toml`

```toml
[default project]
project = "eds_to_rjn"
```

---

### ‚úÖ Cleaner `__main__` Block Using the Default Project

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Dynamically identify the default project from TOML
    project_name = ProjectManager.identify_default_project()
    pm = ProjectManager(project_name)

    # Dynamically load the hook from the default project's script
    snapshot_hook = load_snapshot_hook(pm)

    # Pass all into the daemon
    daemon = DataCaptureDaemon(
        project_manager=pm,
        snapshot_hook=snapshot_hook,
        hourly_hook=run_hourly_ingestion
    )

    daemon.run()
```

---

### üß† Benefits Recap:

- üîÑ Easily switch the active project via TOML ‚Äî no code change needed
    
- ‚ôªÔ∏è `ProjectManager` is now aware of its parent `projects/` structure
    
- üìú Clear separation of config (TOML) and logic (Python)
    

Let me know if you want to enforce `.toml` schema validation or include project-specific logging next.
