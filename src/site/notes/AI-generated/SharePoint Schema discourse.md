# CG 0
SharePoint is one of those things that can either be a total mess or a lifesaver, depending on how it’s set up.

Here’s how it can handle what you’re describing:

---

### 🔧 Core Features You’d Use in SharePoint

1. **Document Libraries**
    
    - Think of these like smart folders.
        
    - Each document gets stored in a library, and you can add _columns_ (metadata fields) beyond just filename:
        
        - Project ID
            
        - Drawing number
            
        - Revision
            
        - Discipline (civil, mech, electrical)
            
        - Status (draft, issued, as-built)
            
        - Source (vendor, consultant, internal)
            
2. **Version Control (built-in)**
    
    - Every time someone uploads a new revision, SharePoint can keep the history.
        
    - You can roll back if someone overwrites a file.
        
    - Versions are tracked at the metadata level too, so you don’t need `FINAL_v3_revised_REALFINAL.pdf`.
        
3. **Check-in / Check-out**
    
    - Stops people from stomping on each other’s edits.
        
    - Gives you a bit of a poor-man’s CAD document control system.
        
4. **Search & Filters**
    
    - Since metadata is indexed, you can filter like a database:
        
        - “Show me all drawings tagged Project A, Mechanical discipline, Revision C.”
            
    - Much more powerful than just searching filenames.
        
5. **Workflows / Power Automate** (optional, but killer if you go this route)
    
    - Automate approvals, document review, notifications.
        
    - Example: Upload a new vendor drawing → auto-email project manager → when approved, auto-move it into “Approved Drawings” library.
        
6. **Permissions**
    
    - You can control who can upload/edit/view on a per-library or per-folder basis.
        
    - Useful if you have external consultants/vendors dropping files in.
        

---

### 🚨 The Catch

- SharePoint doesn’t enforce good metadata unless you design it right.
    
    - If you let people dump files in with no required fields, you’ll just have “SharePoint sprawl.”
        
- You’ll need to **define a schema** (what fields are mandatory, controlled vocabularies for certain columns).
    
- Ideally, you’d also build some **views**: e.g.,
    
    - “All As-Builts by Project”
        
    - “Drawings by Equipment Tag”
        
    - “Outstanding Vendor Submittals”
        

---

### 🆚 Spreadsheet vs Database vs SharePoint

- **Spreadsheet** → chaos, zero enforcement.
    
- **Database** → structured, but you need to build/search it yourself.
    
- **SharePoint** → hybrid: you get structured metadata + built-in UI + search + version control, but you have to design the library schema and train people to use it.
    

---

👉 Question back for you:  
Do you want SharePoint to be the **system of record** (where files actually live), or just an **indexing tool** that points to existing network folders?

That answer changes how I’d recommend setting it up.

---

# CB 1
I am trying to add a column, for managed meta data, which I am calling "Source"

---

# CG 1

Perfect — going with SharePoint puts you right into the sweet spot where you can **enforce consistency with metadata** instead of chasing file names.

If you want your **Source** column to be **Managed Metadata**, here’s the right way to do it:

---

## 🛠️ Steps to Add a Managed Metadata Column in SharePoint

1. **Go to the Document Library Settings**
    
    - Navigate to the library where you want to add the column.
        
    - Click the **gear icon** → **Library settings** (or **List settings** if it’s a list).
        
2. **Create a New Column**
    
    - Under **Columns**, select **Create column**.
        
    - Give it the name: `Source`.
        
    - Choose **Managed Metadata** as the column type.
        
3. **Tie it to a Term Store**
    
    - Managed Metadata means you’re pulling from the **Term Store Management Tool**.
        
    - Open the Term Store (Admin: SharePoint Admin Center → Content Services → Term store).
        
    - Create a new **term set** called something like `Document Sources`.
        
    - Add controlled terms under it (examples):
        
        - Vendor
            
        - Consultant
            
        - Internal Engineering
            
        - OEM Manual
            
        - Submittal
            
4. **Set Column Properties**
    
    - Decide if `Source` should be **required** (recommended).
        
    - Allow only one value or multiple values (for example, a doc could come from “Vendor + Internal Review”).
        
    - Save.
        
5. **Use It in Views**
    
    - Go back to the library.
        
    - Add the `Source` column to the default view so it shows in the grid.
        
    - Now you can filter/sort/group by Source, just like you would in a database.
        

---

## ✅ Benefits of Doing It This Way

- Everyone uses the same controlled vocabulary → no free-text chaos.
    
- If a new category comes up, you just add it to the Term Store — no renaming columns or cleaning up typos.
    
- Documents become filterable/searchable by source across the whole tenant, not just one library.
    
- Later, you can build **views** like “Show me all Vendor documents for Project X, Rev C.”
    

---

⚠️ **Common Gotcha**: If you just add a plain “Choice” column instead of managed metadata, you’ll eventually get inconsistencies (e.g., “Vendor” vs “Vendors”). Term Store is the only way to guarantee global consistency.

---

Do you want me to sketch out a **basic schema for other columns** (like Project, Discipline, Revision, Status) that usually go hand-in-hand with Source, so you don’t box yourself in later?

---

# CB 2
Which columns would you recommend adding for the most rigorous possible document library

---

# CG 2

If you want your SharePoint document library to be **rigorous** (as in, auditable, filterable, and usable as a _system of record_ instead of just a dumping ground), you’ll want to define a **core metadata schema** up front. Think of it as the “skeleton” of your document management system.

Here’s a solid **recommended set of columns** (with notes on which should be **Managed Metadata**, **Choice**, or **Text**):

---

## 🏗️ Core Columns for a Rigorous Document Library

### 1. **Document ID / Number**

- **Type:** Single line of text (or auto-generated with Document ID service).
    
- **Purpose:** Unique identifier (e.g., DRW-00123).
    
- Helps avoid confusion when filenames vary.
    

### 2. **Title / Description**

- **Type:** Text.
    
- **Purpose:** Human-readable name (“P&ID Pumping Station A”).
    

### 3. **Document Type**

- **Type:** **Managed Metadata** (controlled vocab).
    
- **Examples:** Drawing, Specification, O&M Manual, Submittal, P&ID, SOP, Test Report.
    
- **Why:** Keeps categories consistent across projects.
    

### 4. **Discipline**

- **Type:** **Managed Metadata**.
    
- **Examples:** Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Process, I&C.
    
- **Why:** Lets you slice documents by engineering discipline.
    

### 5. **Project / Work Package**

- **Type:** **Managed Metadata** or Lookup.
    
- **Examples:** Project A, Project B, Capital Project #1234.
    
- **Why:** Critical for sorting across projects and reporting.
    

### 6. **Equipment / Asset Tag**

- **Type:** Text (or Lookup if you’ve got an asset registry).
    
- **Examples:** P-101, MCC-02, Tank-4.
    
- **Why:** Allows linking docs directly to plant assets.
    

### 7. **Source**

- **Type:** **Managed Metadata**.
    
- **Examples:** Vendor, OEM, Consultant, Internal Engineering, Contractor.
    
- (The one you’re already building!)
    

### 8. **Revision**

- **Type:** Choice or Text.
    
- **Examples:** A, B, C; 0, 1, 2.
    
- **Why:** Standardizes how revisions are tracked (instead of filenames).
    

### 9. **Status**

- **Type:** Choice (controlled list).
    
- **Examples:** Draft, For Review, Approved, As-Built, Superseded.
    
- **Why:** Clear lifecycle state.
    

### 10. **Effective Date / Issue Date**

- **Type:** Date.
    
- **Why:** Allows sorting by when a revision became active.
    

### 11. **Author / Originator**

- **Type:** Person or Group.
    
- **Why:** Shows who created or uploaded the doc.
    

### 12. **Reviewer / Approver**

- **Type:** Person or Group.
    
- **Why:** Accountability for approvals (auditable trail).
    

### 13. **Confidentiality / Security Level**

- **Type:** Choice.
    
- **Examples:** Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted.
    
- **Why:** Useful if different stakeholders have different access levels.
    

---

## 🔑 Extra (Depending on Your Needs)

- **Superseded By** (Lookup to another doc). → Lets you trace revisions.
    
- **File Format** (auto-extracted from extension).
    
- **Keywords / Tags** (Managed Metadata, optional).
    

---

## 🚨 Golden Rules

- **Use Managed Metadata** whenever you want global consistency (e.g., Document Type, Discipline, Source).
    
- **Make key fields required** (Project, Document Type, Revision, Status, Source) → this forces discipline.
    
- **Don’t overdo free-text fields** → they cause chaos long-term.
    
- **Build custom views** → e.g., “All As-Builts by Discipline” or “Vendor Submittals Awaiting Approval.”
    

---

👉 Do you want me to sketch out a **sample Term Store hierarchy** (like how Document Type, Discipline, and Source might be structured), so you’ve got a taxonomy ready to drop in? That’ll make your SharePoint library much more future-proof.

(Sure)

Perfect — let’s draft a **starter taxonomy** for your SharePoint Term Store. This will give you a **controlled vocabulary** so your “Source,” “Document Type,” and “Discipline” fields never devolve into free-text chaos.

---

# 📚 Example SharePoint Term Store Hierarchy

---

## 🌐 Term Set: **Document Type**

_(Defines what the document actually is)_

- Drawings
    
    - General Arrangement
        
    - P&ID
        
    - Electrical Single Line
        
    - Wiring Diagram
        
    - Layout / Civil
        
- Specifications
    
    - Technical Spec
        
    - Material Spec
        
    - Functional Spec
        
- Manuals
    
    - O&M Manual
        
    - User Manual
        
- Reports
    
    - Test Report
        
    - Inspection Report
        
    - Calculation Package
        
- Procedures
    
    - Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
        
    - Work Instruction
        
- Submittals
    
    - Vendor Submittal
        
    - Contractor Submittal
        
- Miscellaneous
    
    - Correspondence
        
    - Transmittal
        

---

## 🏗️ Term Set: **Discipline**

_(Defines the engineering or organizational discipline)_

- Civil / Structural
    
- Mechanical
    
- Electrical
    
- Process
    
- Instrumentation & Controls (I&C)
    
- Piping
    
- Safety / HSE
    
- Project Management
    
- Operations
    

---

## 🏢 Term Set: **Source**

_(Defines the origin of the document)_

- Internal Engineering
    
- Vendor / OEM
    
- Consultant
    
- Contractor
    
- Client / Owner
    
- Regulator
    
- Other External
    

---

## 📝 Term Set: **Status**

_(Lifecycle state of the document)_

- Draft
    
- For Review
    
- Approved for Construction
    
- Issued for Use
    
- As-Built
    
- Superseded
    

---

## ⚙️ Term Set: **Project (Optional, but scalable)**

_(If you want project tags consistent across libraries)_

- Project A
    
- Project B
    
- Capital Project 1234
    
- Maintenance Project 5678
    

---

### 🔑 Best Practices for Term Store Design

- **Keep it hierarchical**: users can pick a top-level term (“Drawings”) or a child term (“P&ID”).
    
- **Lock it down**: only admins should add/edit terms → users just select.
    
- **Future-proof it**: you can always add new terms later without breaking existing docs.
    
- **Re-use terms** across libraries (SharePoint lets you link the same Term Set globally).
    

---

👉 Do you want me to also map these into a **recommended SharePoint library schema** (which columns are required, which pull from which Term Set), so you’ve basically got a plug-and-play metadata plan?

(Sure)

Alright, here’s a **plug-and-play SharePoint library schema** built on top of the taxonomy we just drafted. Think of this as your “data model” for documents in SharePoint — the rules that will force consistency and make filtering powerful.

---

# 📑 Recommended SharePoint Library Schema

---

## 🔐 Required Columns

_(Every document **must** have these)_

|Column Name|Type|Source / Term Set|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Document ID**|Auto (Doc ID svc)|N/A|Unique identifier; enables traceability across filenames.|
|**Title**|Single line text|N/A|Human-readable name (“Pump Station A P&ID”).|
|**Document Type**|Managed Metadata|Term Set: _Document Type_|Forces classification (Drawing, Spec, Report, etc.).|
|**Discipline**|Managed Metadata|Term Set: _Discipline_|Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, etc.|
|**Project**|Managed Metadata|Term Set: _Project_|Project A, Project B, etc.|
|**Source**|Managed Metadata|Term Set: _Source_|Vendor, Consultant, Internal, etc.|
|**Revision**|Choice|Controlled list (A, B, C or 0, 1, 2)|Avoids free-text chaos.|
|**Status**|Managed Metadata|Term Set: _Status_|Draft, Approved, As-Built, Superseded, etc.|
|**Issue Date**|Date|N/A|Effective date of the revision.|

---

## 👥 Accountability Columns

_(Track who did what)_

|Column Name|Type|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**Author / Originator**|Person/Group|Who created the doc (internal or external).|
|**Reviewer**|Person/Group|Person responsible for review.|
|**Approver**|Person/Group|Final approver; makes this an audit trail.|

---

## ⚙️ Optional / Advanced Columns

_(Use if your organization wants extra rigor)_

|Column Name|Type|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**Equipment Tag**|Single line text (or Lookup to Asset Register)|Allows linking docs to physical assets (P-101, MCC-02).|
|**Superseded By**|Lookup (same library)|Points to the next revision if Status = Superseded.|
|**Confidentiality**|Choice (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted)|Helps control permissions and sensitivity.|
|**Keywords / Tags**|Managed Metadata|Free-form tagging, but still controlled through Term Store.|

---

## 🔎 Example Views You Could Create

- **By Discipline** → group docs into Civil, Mech, Elec.
    
- **Current Approved Docs Only** → filter Status = Approved / As-Built.
    
- **By Source** → see all vendor docs vs internal vs contractor.
    
- **Revision History** → show grouped by Document ID with all revisions stacked.
    
- **Per Project** → quick drill-down for each project team.
    

---

## 🚨 Key Setup Notes

1. **Make the Required Columns actually required** → otherwise SharePoint lets people dump files without metadata.
    
2. **Use Content Types if needed** → if you want slightly different fields for, say, Drawings vs. O&M Manuals, define separate Content Types but keep the core schema consistent.
    
3. **Train your users** → metadata entry is the “tax” for searchability. If people understand it saves hours later, they’ll buy in.
    
4. **Governance** → restrict who can edit the Term Store. You want consistency, not “new term every week.”
    

---

	👉 Want me to take this one step further and sketch a **real-world example** (say: how a vendor P&ID for Project A, Rev B would look in this schema) so you can see it in action?

---
# CB 4
```
I work at a wastewater treatment facility

Our main concern is maintenance, and keeping track of records that have been handed over from contractors including construction and plans

we want to be able to leverage our documents to succeed in finding all useful information quickly to perform maintenance
 
```

---
# CG 4

Got it 👍 — thanks for the context. Since you’re in **wastewater treatment** and your primary driver is **maintenance efficiency**, the way you set up your SharePoint library needs to prioritize:

- 🔍 **Finding the right drawing/manual quickly** when a pump or motor goes down.
    
- 📂 **Linking docs to equipment/assets** (not just projects).
    
- 🏗️ **Capturing handover documents from contractors** in a consistent, retrievable way.
    
- 🛠️ **Ensuring as-builts and O&M manuals are the “source of truth”** for your maintenance team.
    

---

## 🏗️ Tailored Schema for Wastewater Maintenance

Here’s how I’d refine the earlier schema specifically for your world:

### 🔐 Required Columns

|Column Name|Type|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**Asset / Equipment Tag**|Single line text (or Managed Metadata if you have an asset register)|CRITICAL for maintenance — link docs to pumps, blowers, MCCs, tanks.|
|**Document Type**|Managed Metadata|Examples: O&M Manual, As-Built Drawing, P&ID, Shop Drawing, Test Report, Submittal, Spare Parts List.|
|**Discipline**|Managed Metadata|Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, I&C, Process.|
|**Project / Contract**|Managed Metadata|Which project/contract delivered the doc (important for warranty/future upgrades).|
|**Source**|Managed Metadata|Contractor, OEM, Consultant, Internal Eng.|
|**Revision / Version**|Choice|Standardized (A, B, C / 0, 1, 2).|
|**Status**|Managed Metadata|Draft, Approved, As-Built, Superseded.|
|**Issue Date**|Date|When the doc/revision was issued.|

---

### 👥 Accountability Columns

- **Originator** (Contractor/Engineer who submitted).
    
- **Approver** (Plant Eng/PM who signed off).
    

---

### ⚙️ Optional (but highly valuable)

- **Maintenance Category** (Choice) → Preventive, Corrective, Predictive, Emergency.
    
- **Criticality Level** (Choice) → High / Medium / Low (ties into asset criticality).
    
- **Superseded By** (Lookup to other doc) → helps when contractors dump multiple versions.
    
- **Confidentiality** (Choice) → Public/Internal/Restricted.
    

---

## 🔎 Example Search Use Cases

This is where it pays off. Imagine:

- **Pump Failure** → Maintenance tech searches “P-101” → instantly gets O&M manual, wiring diagram, as-built drawing, vendor test cert, and spare parts list.
    
- **Contractor Handover Audit** → Filter by “Project = Upgrade 2023” + “Document Type = O&M Manual” → check all manuals are in.
    
- **Electrical Fault** → Filter by “Discipline = Electrical” + “Asset Tag = MCC-02” → find all schematics tied to that MCC.
    
- **Warranty Check** → Filter by “Source = Contractor X” + “Status = Approved” → verify documentation set.
    

---

## 🚀 Quick Wins for Your Facility

1. **Make Asset Tag REQUIRED** → this is the #1 link between documents and maintenance.
    
2. **Standardize Document Type** → especially O&M Manuals, As-Builts, Test Reports.
    
3. **Build Maintenance-Focused Views** in SharePoint:
    
    - “By Asset Tag”
        
    - “As-Builts Only”
        
    - “O&M Manuals”
        
    - “All Superseded Docs” (so techs don’t accidentally use them)
        
4. **Integrate with CMMS/EAM later** → if you use Maximo, Cityworks, or similar, you can link asset records to SharePoint doc URLs.
    

---

💡 This way SharePoint becomes your **digital filing cabinet**, but instead of just being a place where PDFs sit, it’s structured so maintenance techs can always find _the right info at the right time_.

---

👉 Question for you: do you already have an **asset register** (like pump/motor IDs in a CMMS), or would SharePoint itself need to _become_ the first structured source of asset tagging? That will change whether I suggest a flat “text tag” or a formal Managed Metadata term set for assets.

---
# CB 5

```
Can I have copilot AI populate some of this stuff for me, based on what it finds in the document contents?
```

---

# CG 5

💯 Yes — that’s exactly where **Copilot in SharePoint / M365** can shine for you. It won’t replace a good schema, but it can help **auto-populate metadata** by looking inside your documents (titles, headers, tables, even drawing title blocks if they’re text-based).

---

## ⚙️ What Copilot Can Do for You

1. **Suggest Metadata on Upload**
    
    - When a contractor drops in a PDF called `PumpStationA_P101_AsBuilt.pdf`, Copilot can scan it:
        
        - Spot “P-101” in the title block → auto-suggest **Asset Tag = P-101**
            
        - Spot “As-Built” → auto-suggest **Status = As-Built**
            
        - Spot “Pump Station A” → auto-suggest **Project = Upgrade 2023** (if you’ve got that term set)
            
2. **Summarize Document Contents**
    
    - Click a drawing or manual → Copilot gives a summary:  
        _“This O&M manual covers Pump P-101, including lubrication, bearing replacement, and motor wiring (MCC-02).”_
        
    - You can drop pieces of that summary into metadata fields.
        
3. **Assist Search**
    
    - Even if metadata is missing, Copilot can answer:  
        _“Show me the O&M manual for blower B-301.”_  
        It uses semantic search (reads content, not just metadata).
        
4. **Bulk Classification**
    
    - If you have a big contractor handover dump (hundreds of docs), you can select them in bulk → Copilot suggests metadata values in a batch.
        

---

## 🚨 Limitations / Watch-Outs

- **Accuracy varies** → if title blocks are scanned as images (not OCR’d text), Copilot won’t “see” them. You’d need OCR first.
    
- **Doesn’t enforce rigor** → you still need your Managed Metadata columns and term sets, otherwise suggestions won’t map cleanly.
    
- **Approval workflow is key** → you don’t want AI guessing wrong and creating garbage data. Best setup is _Copilot suggests → user confirms_.
    

---

## 🛠️ How to Set It Up

1. **Define your schema first** (the columns we laid out earlier).
    
2. **Enable Copilot in SharePoint** (requires M365 Copilot license).
    
3. **Train your team**:
    
    - Don’t trust it blindly — treat suggestions like a spell-checker.
        
    - Confirm/adjust before saving.
        
4. **Iterate**: build a feedback loop (e.g., if it mislabels a vendor manual as “internal,” correct it, and Copilot improves).
    

---

## 🚀 Dream Workflow (Wastewater Maintenance Example)

- Contractor uploads `O&M_P101_PumpStationA.pdf`
    
- Copilot reads cover page + title block → suggests:
    
    - Document Type = O&M Manual
        
    - Asset Tag = P-101
        
    - Discipline = Mechanical
        
    - Source = Contractor (XYZ Construction)
        
    - Status = Approved / As-Built
        
- Maintenance engineer reviews, tweaks if needed, saves.
    
- Now that doc is instantly filterable by **Asset Tag** and appears in your “O&M Manuals by Asset” view.
    

---

👉 So yes — Copilot can do **a lot of the grunt work** of populating metadata, but the secret sauce is: **you design the schema, Copilot fills it in, humans approve**.

---

Do you want me to show you a **practical rollout strategy** — like “Phase 1: get schema in place, Phase 2: start with one project handover set, Phase 3: turn Copilot loose on the back-catalog”? That way you don’t drown in a big migration all at once.


---

# CB 6

Can i have copilot crawl existing files?

---

# CG 6

Yes — you **can** have Copilot (or more broadly, Microsoft 365 AI features) work with existing files, but there are some specifics to understand.

---

## How it Works

1. **Files must be in SharePoint or OneDrive for Business**
    
    - Copilot doesn’t automatically read random network drives or local folders.
        
    - You’d need to **migrate existing PDFs, drawings, and manuals** into a SharePoint library.
        
2. **Metadata Crawling**
    
    - Once files are in SharePoint:
        
        - Copilot can **read the contents** of documents (text in PDFs, Word, Excel, etc.).
            
        - It can suggest values for your Managed Metadata columns based on what it finds.
            
    - For scanned drawings or images, you’ll need **OCR first** (SharePoint can OCR PDFs with text layers).
        
3. **Bulk Processing**
    
    - You can select multiple documents → Copilot will attempt to **populate metadata in batch**.
        
    - Suggestions can then be **reviewed and confirmed** before being applied.
        
4. **Search & Semantic Understanding**
    
    - Even if you don’t tag every document manually, Copilot can **search the content** to answer queries like:
        
        > “Show me all O&M manuals for Pump P-101.”
        
    - It can read tables, text blocks, and extract key information (asset tags, project names, drawing numbers).

## ⚠️ Caveats

- **Accuracy depends on text quality**
    
    - PDFs from CAD drawings may need text extraction (OCR) first.
        
- **Copilot does not overwrite existing metadata automatically**
    
    - Suggestions are **review → approve** workflow.
        
- **Big migrations may require planning**
    
    - Start with a pilot project (say, one pump or one system), refine term sets and column mappings, then scale.

## ✅ Recommended Approach

1. **Move all existing documents into a new library** with your rigorous metadata schema.
    
2. **Enable Copilot** and let it scan the library for suggested metadata.
    
3. **Review in batches** — don’t let it tag everything blindly.
    
4. **Iterate and refine term sets** (Document Type, Discipline, Source, Asset Tag) as Copilot encounters new patterns.
    
5. Once confident, **expand to the rest of your facility’s handover records**.

If you want, I can outline a **practical phased rollout plan** for Copilot-assisted metadata population specifically for a wastewater treatment facility — like, first 1 system, then 1 plant section, then full facility — so you don’t get overwhelmed.
