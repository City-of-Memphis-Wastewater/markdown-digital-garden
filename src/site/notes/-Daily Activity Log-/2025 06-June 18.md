# Morning Meeting
- [[People/Carl Stevenson\|Carl Stevenson]]'s plant process updates:
	- TSS is up (50-70 mg/L)
		- This would be our first month with no violations, if we can get our numbers back down.
	- MLSS is up
		- Splitter box gates are open. Closing them should help.
		- Check secondary clarifiers just in case
	- Dewatering facility needs to be sampled
		- Discourse about whether or not the sample should be "the thickest we can find" or "what the contract states".
		- The range we told them they have to meet was 1% to 5%. Typical is 2.3%, according to [[Daniel Montgomery\|Daniel Montgomery]] and [[People/Rodney Williams\|Rodney Williams]].
		- "Keep it above 1% and they can't complain. Anything below 1%, they are required to dewater."  - [[People/Mike Brower\|Mike Brower]]
	- For the month of May, we got down to 2 BOD violations. Typically we have 150 violations. Now we are down to 8 total violations.

- Blood drive on Friday [[-Daily Activity Log-/2025 06-June 20\|2025 06-June 20]].
- Hypothetical break in the the line somewhere. At the screens there is wood,  
- Raw sewage pump #2 went out last night.
	- It is electrically tripped on over voltage.
		- 5 possible criteria to cause this code
			- Power switch from AC to DC
			- Power outage from MLGW
			- ....
		- Cables could be compromised inside the drive.
	- #2 can also have kicked the bucket like #3. Which leave only #4. And we cannot bypass because the river is too high (it has to be below the bypass.)
	- We have what it takes to rebuild #1, though we need to monitor for damage to the mag on #1. 
		- Kim: we have the shaft to do the rebuild
		- Carl: We are expecting rain. We are already backed up.
		- Gary: I need to be on the phone right now.
		- Carlton: We need cooling fans on #4.
		- The shaft we have is not made out of 4140. 
			- Control speed to decrease likelihood of breakage. 
		- [x] Clayton: communicate to [[Information Heap/Don McCommon\|Don McCommon]] to go ahead and make the beefy shaft.
		- [ ] Clayton: Choose a handheld vibration monitor to spot check the vibration on the mag drive.
		- Mike: Can we put the spare motor for #4 on one of the other raw sewage pumps? No, Gary says we did not send it out for repair.
		- Mike: How long would it take Xylem to set up a pump around?
		- Daniel: Why do we think #2 is done? Maybe it is not. Maybe #3 is not either.
			- Hose to 14 north manhole to send it back to the head of the plant.
			- Chris: Try it, but watch the impacts and know when to stop.
		- Ken Frost: Why can't we bypass? The river is too high, as per Don Hudgins.
			- If we open the gate, it relies on gravity to go down. It actually is coming back up.
	- How to monitor the mag? How will it fail? Can we monitor it for piece of mind, with vibration, harmonics, yada yada yada?
- Raw sewage pumps
	- Convert #2 and #3 to mag drives, though there is concern for weight. This will overcome a cooling problem in the IPA building.
