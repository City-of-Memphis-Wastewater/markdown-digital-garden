I had a weird occurrence when I started my computer - it defaulted to a mostly-blank account. Installed programs failed to launch. However, I was able to log into Edge, with my defaults intact.
I restarted the computer and it is working as normal now.

Today:
- Pavlov grouping-by-directory
- Meeting with Pete Gabor at 1:30 PM
- Convert abandoned points to "Spare" in Drop 212
	- How to fully delete a point:
		- Look for where used
		- Disconnect from hardware
		- Trust Pete blindly?
- Install LibreOffice on Drop 212.
	- Weird: Some files that need to be updated are currently in use: which files are likely for this?


- [x] Call back Emerson SureService
- [x] Call Pete Gabor to discuss disused points
