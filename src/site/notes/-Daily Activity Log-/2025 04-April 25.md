Hello,  
I would like to ask the EDS API engineers about the trend functions. There are in the "Trends" section, on pages 34-37 of a document I was sent previously during this ticket, EDS REST API Python Examples.pdf.  
  
I can generate the query id using the GET call to the 'trend/tabular' url.  
However, when I use this query id (appended to the url) with the related POST call, i get back an empty list.  
  
My time stamps are from 2 days prior. I have tried step = 60 and step = 1.  
  
It appears that the Python bindings are incomplete, that this function was never fully set up by the EDS API developers, and it simply returns an empty list.  
  
I have tried with the wrong query id - and this gives a warning. With the correct query id, I get a status 200, just no data.  
  
See image for my method and the output.
```
