[[Information Heap/Leverage PowerTools for hotkey functionality to call a script using input from the clipboard tray\|Leverage PowerTools for hotkey functionality to call a script using input from the clipboard tray]]

```

i liked the idea of highlighting any text and then calling the process

maybe that's a different piece of software entirely. That could be really cool, people would like that. This would greatly advance a Python stack that is pipx installable and registers a context menu item to the registry. And then i could leverage it for the pipeline tool but first i need to build that generalized tool in COM, or to register the tool as a hotkey with powertools that pulls input from the clipboard tray
