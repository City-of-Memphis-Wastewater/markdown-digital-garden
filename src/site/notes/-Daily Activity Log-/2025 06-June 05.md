[Python Constants: Improve Your Code's Maintainability â€“ Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-constants/#handling-your-constants-in-a-real-world-project)

What about variables that have default values loaded from config but also can be altered after program startup, and can be persistent across a multiple page GUI? There needs to be a way for a object that holds these variables to be program-wide, and then for it to allow for alteration, either through async methods, getters and settes, or some other standard practice. 

# Ovation
iess example: M100FI.UNIT0@NET0
idcs example: M100FI

# pipeline
 refactor code like this 
```
 eds_api, headers_eds_maxson = get_eds_maxson_token_and_headers(config_obj)
```

to involve a config_manager
