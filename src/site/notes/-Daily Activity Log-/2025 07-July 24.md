### Rust Run Error, Bad Installation Assumed
Console print: "**error:** the 'rust-gdbgui.exe' binary, normally provided by the 'rustc' component, is not applicable to the 'stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc' toolchain"
When: trying to run: ``` C:\Users\george.bennett\.cargo\bin\rust-gdbgui.exe
	```

What does this mean? It means I installed the wrong version of Rust given the admin opportunity, in conjunction with City of Memphis IT.
