## [1.1.1] - 2025-12-26

### Added

- Implemented a `src/` layout to improve package isolation and follow modern Python packaging best practices.
    
- Moved `__main__.py` into the package namespace to support `python -m pyhabitat` execution.
    
- Added a prioritized "Editor Ladder" to `edit_textfile` that favors lightweight standalone editors (gedit, mousepad, kate) over heavy IDEs (VS Code) to prevent workspace pollution.
    

### Changed

- Refactored `build_pyz.py` and `build_executable.py` to support the new `src/` directory structure.
    
- Enhanced `edit_textfile` logic to provide a robust fallback to `nano` when `xdg-open` or GUI editors are unavailable, preventing shell crashes in headless environments.
    
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to use `setuptools` find-package logic within the `src` directory.
    

### Fixed

- Resolved a "bad interpreter" error in WSL caused by CRLF-encoded Windows shims taking priority over Linux binaries.
    
- Corrected a PyInstaller argument ordering bug in the executable build script.
    
- Suppressed `xdg-open` error noise when system-level mailcap rules or file associations are missing.
