	- ``` My name is Christopher Morrical and I work for the City of Memphis in Environmental Admin. I am familiar with WW and think it is an amazing science. I worked in Industrial Monitoring which used to be located at the Stiles WWTP and I was fortunate enough to take one of the Sacramento (https://www.owp.csus.edu/courses/wastewater.php) self-paced WW training courses that I really enjoyed. I worked in environmental construction for a couple of years and then moved over to Administrator of Environmental Construction for the Consent Decree SARP10 Program. SARP10 is run by Black & Veatch. Â I will reach out to the BV team to get you access to the viewer.```
