Meeting after the meeting:
- Rodney Williams presides
- Disciplinary, tardiness
- UKG apparently does not keep up with everything.
- Jargon
	- Oral reprimand versus written reprimand
	- Charge letter
	- Fact finding hearing
- Outcome: Do write-ups directly, rather than waiting for it to be triggered in UKG.
- Old way: Wait on UKG, based on clock-in records, to send reprimands, and then supervisors can give them out.
- Suspension = charge letter and fact finding hearing. 
- The whole purpose of the UKG software was supposed to ease the load on supervisors. The UKG software keeps up with the data. And they send oral reprimands, written reprimands, and charge letters. 
- Mike's recommendation: You can make reprimands without waiting for UKG.
