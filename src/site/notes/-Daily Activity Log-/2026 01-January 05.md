Happy new year

# uv.toml vs pyproject.toml
```
`uv.toml` vs `pyproject.toml`

they serve different purposes:

- **`pyproject.toml` (Project Standard):** This defines the "truth" for anyone who clones your repo. By putting `default-groups = ["dev", "test"]` here, you ensure that every developer on your team (or your future self on a different machine) starts with the same environment.
    
- **`uv.toml` (Local/User Override):** This is typically used for settings that are specific to your machine or workflow style (like your `link-mode = "copy"` for Android compatibility).
    

**Recommendation:** Keep default-groups in **`pyproject.toml`**. It makes the project "self-documenting." If a new engineer joins the City of Memphis SCADA team and runs `uv sync`, they will automatically get the `test` and `dev` tools they need without needing a custom `uv.toml`.
