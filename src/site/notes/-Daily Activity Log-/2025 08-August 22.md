# Maxson Aeration System
[[Allen Metters\|Allen Metters]] was the Electrical foreman at Maxson in 2017. Allen specc'd and approved the Emerson / [[Information Heap/CSI machine health system\|CSI machine health system]]. However, the building and the environmental controls were never put in place to protect the system from corrosion.

Emerson's general rule is that equipment is obsolete after 10 years - this is an internal general rule, not represented in contract. 

CSI spun off from Emerson, so the unit is entirely disconnected from our Emerson contract.

Emerson has a machine health system with modules that plug directly into the controller. The RTD's and vibration sensors all come into the central DCS.
