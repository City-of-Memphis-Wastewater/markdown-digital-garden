### Alternative Setup: Building from Source (pip)
This method is necessary for environments like Termux and Alpine/iSH where full Poetry support is not practical or where you prefer to use standard pip for dependency management after cloning the repository or unpacking the .tar.gz source distribution.

##### For Termux (Android)
Termux does not support Poetry. You must manually install system dependencies and then use pip in a virtual environment.

1.  Install Python and System Dependencies

```bash     
# Update package lists and upgrade existing packages
pkg update && pkg upgrade
# Install core Termux packages needed for Python scientific libraries
pkg install python-numpy rust
```

2.  Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
    Though not strictly required by Termux, using a virtual environment is a strong best practice.
    
```bash
python -m venv .venv     
source .venv/bin/activate
```
   
3.  Install Python Dependencies
    First, generate the requirements.txt file from pyproject.toml (if not already present), then install.    
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
4.  Run Commands

```bash
python -m pipeline.cli configure     
```
##### For Alpine Linux / iSH (iOS)
Alpine uses MUSL, which requires installing specific package variants. cryptography and keyring are notable blockers due to MUSL compatibility, but a workaround is possible.

1.  Install System Dependencies
    
```bash     
# Install pip and the required cryptography backend for MUSL
apk add python py3-pip py3-cryptography py3-numpy
```
     
2.  Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
    Using a virtual environment is a strong best practice.
   
```bash 
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3.  Install Python Dependencies
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4.  Run Commands

```bash 
python3 -m pipeline.cli trend M100FI
```
