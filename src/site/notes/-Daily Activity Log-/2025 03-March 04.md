Mike,

Excellent job helping to get our influent flow correct! We will continue to monitor the value. 

I will keep a trend of influent (M100 ) vs effluent (WEST + EAST), versus time. 

I will get the point addresses for sludge coming out of the secondary and primary clarifiers, the sum ($WAS_SUM) of which should be lower than out return lagoon liquids. Such that M100 should equal about WEST + EAST + $WAS_SUM.  
  

Attached is a list of the flow meter points across the plant, for reference.

  

Secondary Clarifiers:  
Today we discussed setting the limits on the secondary clarifiers. 

We decided to change the range of the meters to 0 to 30 MGD
