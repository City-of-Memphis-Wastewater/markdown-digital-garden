# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is (read: strives to be) based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.1.4] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- Implemented a complete CLI using `typer` for argument parsing and `rich` for formatted console output.
    
- Established project packaging and distribution via `pipx` by defining the entry point in `pyproject.toml`.
    
- Added a GitHub Actions workflow (`publish.yml`) for automated building and publishing to PyPI using `uv` and Trusted Publishing (OIDC).
    
- Integrated full `PyMuPDF` link extraction logic, capable of distinguishing between:
    
    - External URI links (75 found in the sample file).
        
    - Internal GoTo/Destination links (247 found).
        
    - Structural Table of Contents (40 entries found).
        

### Changed

- Replaced the placeholder `run_analysis` function with the fully functional `PyMuPDF`-based logic.
    
- Replaced all usage of `poetry` in CI/CD pipeline with the faster package manager `uv`.
    
- Moved platform compatibility checks to `src/pdflinkcheck/cli.py` to prevent hard-crashes upon import on non-supported platforms (e.g., Termux).
    

### Removed

- Removed the dummy `get_pdf_file` and placeholder `call_v7`/`call_v8`/`call_stable` functions from the core analysis module.
    
- Deleted the deprecated dependency `borb` and its associated files, significantly streamlining the codebase.
