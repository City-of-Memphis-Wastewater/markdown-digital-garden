- Meeting with Black & Veatch
- MaxOps: Get collapsed JSON export to function - collapsed list TOML may be better
- Discussion with Noah about the Lagoon 5 project and the Black & Veatch primary pump project
- Receive documentation from Mars for the BioRem moisture release equipment
- MaxOps: Intended vs entry ISO's fixed. Still getting NaN in the collapsed rather than null
