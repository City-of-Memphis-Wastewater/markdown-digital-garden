> - The NDIR bench needs replacement.  During final testing it was resetting each time the values needed to be saved.  All connectors, internal components, and the IR board itself were checked.  A new NDIR bench was installed and no negative issues were experienced.  After replacing the new NDIR with the old NDIR, the resetting occurred, again.

First step:

- OR we go through the bid process.
- If we were going to buy an SWG100, then we would bid it out on a requisition process - this requires a submission in Oracle.
- Stephanie does all the Oracle work.
- We are tasked with building the specification. There is not a standard specification.
- If you want a particular piece of equipment, you get the speciation from the supplier and then generalize it for submission. We must go out for public notice. If another supplier
