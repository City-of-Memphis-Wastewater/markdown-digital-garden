The markers Git uses to delineate conflicting sections of a file—`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`—always consist of **seven** repeating characters.

## 📝 Git Merge Conflict Markers

The format of a manually merged file when Git cannot auto-resolve is:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
(Code in your current branch)
=======
(Code from the branch you are merging/pulling)
>>>>>>> branch-name-or-commit-hash
```

| **Marker** | **Characters** | **Purpose**                                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<<<<<<<`  | 7              | Marks the **start** of the conflict block and the beginning of **your** changes (the `HEAD` version).                              |
| `=======`  | 7              | Separates the two versions of the conflicting code.                                                                                |
| `>>>>>>>`  | 7              | Marks the **end** of the conflict block and the end of the **incoming** changes (the version from the branch/commit being pulled). |

The string that follows `<<<<<<<` is typically `HEAD` (meaning your current state, before the pull/merge), and the string following `>>>>>>>` is a **unique identifier** for the incoming changes (usually the branch name or the commit hash). These identifiers can be of variable length, but the delimiters themselves (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) are always seven characters long.

Knowing this fixed length can be helpful when writing automated scripts to parse conflict files, though most modern editors handle this visualization for you!
