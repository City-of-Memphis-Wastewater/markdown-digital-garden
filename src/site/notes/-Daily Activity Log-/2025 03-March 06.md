# Morning meeting
- Trickling filter #1 will be started at 8:15
- Cabinet and sink replacement at dewatering
- spray nozzle / end cap on spray system on primary clarifier #3. There is a ball valve to cut it off.
- Reaeration blowers - issues with #3, it went out three times last night. #1 and #2 could also be reset. TSS numbers are looking good at 49 and 40, which indicates that we have a good enough air supply to shut it off for a reset.
- Primary sludge pump #4. Needs to be wired up
- Fiber has been located at the back of the building. To check it, a light needs to be signed from one end from the other. Can it be cut and spliced effectively? "At $60-120/hr, a fusion splice in a drop location will cost $30-$60 labor plus the splicing cost. A mechanical splice would also require cable prep time, plus the $5 - $12 connector price. Even less expensive than that is using pre-terminated fiber cable."
