Work from home today


- [x] Order #coveralls, to enhance my ability and willingness to go to #thefield
- [x] Set up Edge browser for remote access
- [x] Access and edit Obsidian notes remotely, via OneDrive
- [ ] Toggle Publish, to sync to *Maxson-Engineering-Notes*
- [ ] Communicate with Matthew East, [[people/Pete Gabor]], et al, about Teams meeting for (Th 23 Jan) or (F 24 Jan)
- [x] Try to edit [[-/~Welcome to Maxson~]] by uploading this new file direcly to GitHub, via Edge browser login.

If i can put the app data for Obsidian on my work computer in a OneDrive location (my Files/Apps), then i should be able to sync my Obsidian settings across a remote instance.
Really, I just need to be able to run "Publish" on the Digital Garden plugin in my Obsidian instance at work

This should be doable by sycing the Obsidian instance settings, and then by adding the github fine grained token to the local instance digial garden settings. Even if the instances arent synced, i wonder if it would still work, with the same token, and choosing to only add and not delete the delta.

We're getting a weird phenomenon where this new 22 Jan daily note does upoad and propogate, but it reroutes to the home page rather than showing this text content.
