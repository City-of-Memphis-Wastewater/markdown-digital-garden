On Friday [[Daily Activity Log/31 January 2025\|31 January 2025]], Henry told me I will be responsible for the [[Systems/BioRem\|BioRem]] system.

- [x] OV100 course with Meghana Avula: [[Organizations/Conservation Organizations/OV100 Training\|OV100 Training]]

Great link for setting up GUI apps on WSL2 Ubuntu: [nvidia-driver is installed, but the driver is not loaded - Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1292278/nvidia-driver-is-installed-but-the-driver-is-not-loaded).
- [x] Converted existing WSL Ubuntu from version 1 to version 2. Be careful out there, kids, version 1 still walks among us.
	- Check version: wsl --list --verbose
	- Change version: wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2

Tomorrow: [[Daily Activity Log/04 February 2025\|04 February 2025]]
