Jesco MAGDOS LB: [MAGDOS LB](https://www.lutz-jesco.com/en/products/dosing-pumps/solenoid-diaphragm-dosing-pumps/magdos-lb/)
Description: Solenoid Diaphragm Dosing Pumps MAGDOS LB

System: [[Systems/BioAir\|BioAir]]

Mike and I talked about the vibration and leak problem on Jesco MAGDOS LB system (pictured below)Â at BioAir. The unit needs additional fixturing to minimize vibration.
Strategies: 
1. Beefier bracket (example below)
2. Secondary mount point: (hypothetical design below)

Example of a beefy bracket:

We could use the existing mounting holts with new bolts that have secondary thread in the head, and then extend over the unit to a secondary mounting point.
