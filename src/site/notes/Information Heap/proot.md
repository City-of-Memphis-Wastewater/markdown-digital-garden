## What is $\text{proot}$?

**$\text{proot}$** is a **user-space implementation of $\text{chroot}$**, designed primarily to enable the execution of programs with an alternative root directory without needing special privileges (like `root` access or `CAP_SYS_CHROOT` capability).

- **Meaning:** The name `proot` is generally short for **P**seud-**root** or **P**rocess **root**.
    
- **How it Works:** It uses a feature called $\text{ptrace}$ (a system call that allows one process to control another) to monitor and intercept system calls related to file paths and processes. When a program tries to access a file (e.g., `/bin/bash`), `proot` intercepts that call and silently redirects it to a different path _within its custom environment_ (e.g., `/data/data/com.andronix/files/ubuntu/bin/bash`).
    
- **Purpose on Android:** Android apps like Termux, Andronix, and UserLand use `proot` to safely run full Linux distributions. This is essential because standard Android phones do not allow users the necessary root access to use the genuine $\text{chroot}$ command, which would be the traditional way to containerize a Linux environment.

## What $\text{PRoot}$ Means

**$\text{PRoot}$** stands for **P**seud-**root** (or **P**rocess **root**).

It is a **user-space implementation of $\text{chroot}$** (change root).

|**Feature**|**chroot (Traditional Linux)**|**PRoot (Used by Andronix/Termux)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Needs Root Access**|**Yes** (Requires elevated privileges)|**No** (Runs completely in user space)|
|**Mechanism**|A **kernel syscall** that genuinely changes the root directory.|A **user-space program** that intercepts system calls and redirects file paths using $\text{ptrace}$.|
|**Purpose**|To run a Linux environment without modifying the host's root file system.||

Since most Android phones don't allow un-rooted users to use the traditional $\text{chroot}$ command, $\text{PRoot}$ is the necessary workaround to containerize a full Linux distribution like Ubuntu or Fedora on Android.
