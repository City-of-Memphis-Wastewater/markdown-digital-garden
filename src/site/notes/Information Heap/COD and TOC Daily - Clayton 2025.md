Necessary steps and barriers
- We need to order TOC test kits

Excerpts and Quotes:
- Mike: 
```
Tammy Franklin is currently using the DR 6000 to do COD here at Maxson, so Clayton and I will work with Tammy to be sure he knows the process for running COD and then TOC.  Everything necessary is here already for COD, we will just need to order more for the added testing.

  

The Evonik PLC is only displaying the results as COD.  It might be possible to get them to let us have access to the raw data for TOC.  If not, we can establish our own ratio of our grab to their instantaneous reading, and our TOD reading both with our COD and theirs.  Then if we do get their TOC readings, we can see how close they all are.

Tammy Franklin is very familiar with the COD testing, but as far as I know, the plant lab has no experience with performing TOC tests. So, the TOC testing will be something new to all of them. I am sure that getting the COD testing going will help Tammy and Clayton to get up to speed on the TOC testing.

So as to not step on the toes of the plant and operations personnel who are performing tests in the TEM plant lab, Clayton should work closely with Tammy Franklin on the areas of the lab that he could place his equipment and perform his tests. He definitely will need space in the lab hood to perform the COD testing, especially the “cooking” in the reactor block. He also needs to wear the acid chemical resistant gloves and eye protection (safety glasses or chemical goggles) while performing the tests. He also may need a lab coat, not necessarily from the uniform company, but lab coats can be readily purchased from safety vendors or industrial suppliers.

Facts:
- Operators are pulling grab samples 8 times per day - 
- It takes five to seven minutes for Evonik's Hach analyzer to work
- Solae calculates their BOC from a COD with a correlation
- Most of the time of a COD test is preparing the sample, using cooking and a digestion block.
- 

Purpose:
- Build a correlation, to be able to use TOC instead of COD 

Experimental Design 
- At least one TOC and one COD a day, 5 days per week
