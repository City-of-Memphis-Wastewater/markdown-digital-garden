### Interesting items, concerning proper bidding
- "Good faith effort" for [[WIFIA\|WIFIA]] goals
- Specifications section 00100, "Instructions for Bidders"
- Contractors must hire Emerson as a sub, through [[People/Matt Dannemueller\|Matt Dannemueller]]. There might be an allowance for this.
- Expected completion time is 550 days (about 1.5 years). However, contractors present feel that this is short.

### Contractor concerns:
- Ring wall design.
- Will they be responsible for spreading it? Yes.
- Where will they be able to setup dewatering equipment? Currently unclear, but the city will be flexible.
- What is the power rating? 480. Delivered to the same area as intended controls, at the NE northeast corner of lagoon 5.
- Unit price for offsite disposal? Pending, intended. Reliant on how much we can dispose on site. 
- This project is expected to generate 40,000 pounds of sludge to dispose of. Annual disposal at City of Memphis is limited to 30,000 pounds of sludge.
- Is there a negotiated unit price at the landfill?
- Will this be considered hazardous? I.e., Will there be limitations on landfills accepting the mass. The South Shelby County landfill only accepted a certain amount. Tunica is likely to accept more, but it too costly to truck so far.
- Because this is a heavy civil job, and it will require bulldozers, will BV and the City consider using highway rates versus building rates? Not typical.
