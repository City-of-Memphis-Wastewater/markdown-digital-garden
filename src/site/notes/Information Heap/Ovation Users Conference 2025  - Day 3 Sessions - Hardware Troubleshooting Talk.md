## Hardware Troubleshooting Talk
- Redundant I/O
- John Abrera's idea that an error must also offer you a solution.
- Jargon
	- RNI: Remote Node
	- Branch Fuse
- Troubleshooting Fast Ethernet RNI
	- Be mindful of the type of connection between the controller and RNI, Legacy Redundancy, versus Standard Redundancy
	- View the status of each node.
	- Check to see if the point is timed out: if so, the available information is not valid.
- RSTi
	- RSTi-EP is a remote I/O system
	- Good for decentralized and remote applications that are hard to reach
	- Good for PLC replacement
	- Based on [[Modbus\|Modbus]] protocol
