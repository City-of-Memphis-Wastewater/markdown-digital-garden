### The Juniper Project

#### For Upper Management:

**Juniper is a strategic investment in efficiency and operational intelligence.** We are transforming our plant graphics from static, 2D images into dynamic, data-rich visualizations. By creating a modern, repeatable process, we can reduce engineering hours, improve visual clarity for operators, and ensure our control systems are as advanced as our physical assets. Juniper leverages existing digital data to save time and deliver a higher-quality product, making our operations safer and more intuitive.

#### For Primary Contractors and Engineering Firms:

**Juniper ensures your design data has a life beyond the construction phase.** Your detailed CAD, P&ID, and GIS files are valuable intellectual property. Our open-source pipeline translates that data into the specific language required for our plant's control system. This means the precise, dimensionally accurate models you build can be seamlessly integrated into our operator displays. With Juniper, your digital deliverables become a living part of the plant, improving handover and enabling us to make faster, more informed decisions based on the accurate data you provide.

#### For Ovation Employees:

**Juniper enhances the power of the Ovation platform.** Our project is a robust, external tool that complements the Ovation Graphics Builder. It is not a replacement, but an extension that allows us to integrate data from modern design tools—such as Blender, FreeCAD, and D3.js—into the Ovation environment. Juniper is designed to be fully compatible with the proprietary Ovation `.src` file format, providing a new way to rapidly create and update graphics. This frees up engineering time for more complex, high-value tasks, allowing us to deliver more sophisticated solutions to our users.

#### For Developers and Potential Maintainers:

**Juniper is a chance to build the future of the industrial web.** This isn't just about drawing lines and circles; it's about solving a fundamental problem that bridges two worlds: the static, closed systems of industrial control and the dynamic, open web.

Your skills in modern web development, data visualization, and software engineering are directly applicable here. This is an exciting opportunity to:

- **Learn a new domain:** Dive into the fascinating world of industrial automation, where every line of code can affect a real-world process. This is a unique chance to apply your expertise to a mission-critical field.
    
- **Contribute to the open source community:** Juniper is a blank canvas. We need architects to design a flexible pipeline, Python developers to build robust translation logic, and front-end engineers to create beautiful, reusable `D3.js` components. Your code will directly help plant operators better understand and manage their systems.
    
- **Pioneer the industrial web:** We are building a "compiler" that translates modern web-based designs into a proprietary format. This is a crucial step toward a future where plant graphics are no longer limited by a single vendor's tools. By working on this project, you will be on the front lines of making industrial systems more accessible, intelligent, and visually intuitive.
    

Join us in creating the next generation of control room graphics. This is a chance to build something tangible, impactful, and lasting.
