Strategy:

- Emerson Ovation .diag file
	- Create rectangles that change in width based on flow volume through a linked system. Do not change height. Keep rectangles centered. See pen-and-paper drawing below.
- Excel:
	- Use an Excel add-in, such as ChartExpo, and insert a sankey chart from the My Apps menu, then select your data and create the chart

I want to represent flow through the plant based on volume. Something like this: ![Pasted image 20250207140626.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250207140626.png)
