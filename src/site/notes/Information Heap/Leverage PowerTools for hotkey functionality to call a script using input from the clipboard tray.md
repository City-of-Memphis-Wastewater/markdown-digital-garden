### 1️⃣ What PowerToys Provides

PowerToys is a suite of utilities for Windows, including:

- **FancyZones** – window management
    
- **PowerRename** – batch rename
    
- **Keyboard Manager** – remap keys
    
- **PowerToys Run** – Spotlight-like launcher (search apps, files)
    
- **Always on Top** – window pinning
    
- **Color Picker, Awake, etc.**
    

Of interest to you:

- **PowerToys Run** can execute commands via hotkeys.
    
- **Shortcut/hotkey triggers** are supported.
    
- **Clipboard history** is built-in (Windows 10+), which PowerToys can leverage.

### 2️⃣ How it could help your use case

You want:

> Highlight text anywhere → right-click → send to Python CLI tool

PowerToys can’t **add a universal right-click menu in arbitrary apps**. But you could:

1. **Use PowerToys Run or a hotkey**
    
    - Assign a global hotkey (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+P`) to run a Python script.
        
    - User highlights text → copies it → presses the hotkey → Python script is called with clipboard content.
        
    - This avoids needing COM or a shell extension.
        
2. **Clipboard + tray app**
    
    - PowerToys doesn’t natively expose clipboard hooks to external scripts.
        
    - But you can rely on **Windows Clipboard + Python background process**, possibly paired with a PowerToys hotkey.

### 3️⃣ Limitations

- PowerToys doesn’t let you **inject right-click menu items into every app’s context menu**.
    
- No official API to “extend text selection menu globally.”
    
- Essentially, it’s a **hotkey + clipboard launcher**, not a true universal context menu.

### ✅ Bottom line

You **can leverage PowerToys** to simplify your workflow:

- Use its **global hotkey system** as a trigger.
    
- Your Python tool reads the clipboard and processes the text.
    
- This is far easier than building a COM-based universal text menu.
    

It would give your users:

- A “highlight text → copy → hotkey → run pipeline” workflow
    
- A pipx-installable Python tool
    
- No VBA, no COM, no shell extensions

**Sketch a concrete design** for a **PowerToys + Python clipboard launcher** that integrates with a pipx installable CLI and could eventually be expanded into a COM extension later.
