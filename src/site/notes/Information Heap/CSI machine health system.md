CSI is no longer a part of the Emerson family of companies.
The aeration basin machine health system was purchased in 2017 but was never set up.

> Matt,

> The previous electrical foreman had purchased that equipment circa 2017 without any consideration for how it might be installed. Money was not allocated after the fact to stabilize this initial minor oversight. And now it is years fallow.

> In this regard, I would like to set a standard that we should have a dual assessment of "anticipated success". I would like for this to be considered from the Emerson perspective as well. Every equipment project that we pursue, in terms of purchasing equipment from Emerson, should be evaluated for how likely the project is to succeed.

> Equipment becoming defunct or unserviceable, such as the CSI equipment, is a great example of equipment that has not successfully been implemented and is moreso not useful because of Emerson's sale of CSI when the companies split. In the future, if we anticipate this sort of loss of utility of equipment over a short time span, we shouldn't be buying that equipment at all. I hope you will be able to help us identify risks of this sort in the future, and that you would be willing to warn off whoever might be holding the purse strings at that time.
