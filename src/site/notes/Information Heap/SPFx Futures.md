# Claude:
Based on the current information, SharePoint Framework (SPFx) appears to be a solid long-term solution. SPFx is the most widely used extensibility model in Microsoft 365 and continues to be supported also in future.

Recent evidence from 2025 strongly supports this view. "The commitment to SPFx as a long-term platform is crystal clear. While other Microsoft 365 platforms are reducing investment to focus on AI agents, the SPFx team is doubling" down on their investment, according to reports from the European Collaboration Summit 2025.

Key factors supporting SPFx as a long-view solution:

**Strong Microsoft Commitment**: Microsoft has positioned SPFx as their primary extensibility framework for SharePoint and Microsoft Teams, with active roadmap development continuing through 2025 and beyond.

**Strategic Integration**: SPFx integrates deeply with the broader Microsoft 365 ecosystem, including Teams, Viva Connections, and SharePoint Online, making it central to Microsoft's collaboration strategy.

**Active Development**: Recent roadmap updates show continued investment in new capabilities, modern development patterns, and AI integration features.

**Market Position**: As the successor to the retiring SharePoint add-in model, SPFx has become the recommended approach for SharePoint customization and extensibility.

**Enterprise Adoption**: The framework has gained significant enterprise traction, which typically ensures longer-term platform stability and support from Microsoft.

However, like any Microsoft technology, it's worth monitoring annual roadmap updates and considering how emerging technologies (particularly AI agents and Copilot integrations) might influence development priorities. But based on current evidence, SPFx represents a strategic, well-supported platform for long-term SharePoint development investments.
