1. Safety
2. Progress
	- GMP-4
		- Odor control system, 500 kVA transformer ([[Max Foote\|Max Foote]])
		- Tricking filter IPA electrical gear ([[Eaton\|Eaton]]/[[CED\|CED]])
	- GMP-5
		- ([[Max Foote\|Max Foote]]) Glassing, interior fiberglass pipe for trickling filter 3. More. 
		- ([[VuCon\|VuCon]]) Install condensate line for TF2 and TF3. Asphalt. FRP supports.
		- ([[Contractors/Tri-State Armature\|Tri-State Armature]]) Electrical and lighting protection for TF1. Pull wire for dispersion fans, TF2 and TF3.
		- ([[Contractors/Emerson\|Emerson]]) Ovation programming, trickling filters.
		- ([[FSE\|FSE]]) Inspect interior and exterior duct for TF2 and TF3
		- ([[Contractors/WesTech\|WesTech]]) Pan test TF1, certified RDA installation
	- Current activities: See PDF below.
		- [[FailureModes/Hydrogen sulfide\|Hydrogen sulfide]] concentrations are higher than expected. [[Systems/BioAir\|BioAir]] is pushing back on target values. System 3 is the [[screw pumps\|screw pumps]]. Relevant [[SRF loan\|SRF loan]]. The BioAir systems takes gas from the influent and effluent of the screw pumps, and two of the primary clarifiers. We should get our own hydrogen sulfide meters to put on 1 and 3.
		- Max Foote - reprogramming overhead doors
		- Electricians - labelling in blower building
		- [[Equipment/RAS blowers\|RAS blowers]] keep tripping due to rain coming in. Point people: [[People/Gary Garrison\|Gary Garrison]] and [[People/Noah McClellan\|Noah McClellan]].
		- Interior and exterior duct. Curbs. Covers. Fans.
		- Shelby Electric is wiring.
		- Valve leakage in diverter. We need a more permanent solution in the future.
	- Projected completion: January 2026 (not June 2027)
