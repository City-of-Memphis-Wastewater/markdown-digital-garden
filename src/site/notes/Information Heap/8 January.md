Shear membrane filters versus FOG

FOG disposal - landfill, biodiesel, soap manufactures, anaerobic digesters 


anaerobic digesters produce biogas
Eastbay Mud in California has produced enough [[Chemicals/Biogasses\|Biogasses]] to be net zero
They use the biogas to make CNG to power their vehicles, and burn it in a boiler to produce electricity
CNG is 99% methane, and is gaseous
Air to fuel ratio ideal air-to-cng is 30:1 (lean burn - burns a lot hotter)
burning hot produces more NOx, above 1400 Farenheitt, which burns the N2 in the atmosphere

Ideal burning temp for natural gas: 1100 to 1400 degrees (hot enough to burn CO)
CO has energy value



WAS - main reason to send to the lagoons to digest - purpose, reduce vector attraction, thereby reducing waterborne disease

Later goals:
