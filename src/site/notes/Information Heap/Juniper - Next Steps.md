### Project Summary: The Juniper Pipeline

Project Name: Juniper

Objective: To revolutionize the creation of Emerson Ovation plant graphics by establishing a modern, repeatable, and scalable pipeline.

**The Problem:** The current process for creating Ovation graphics is a time-consuming, manual, and proprietary process that limits creativity and prevents the use of modern design and data-rich assets.

**The Solution:** Juniper is a three-part, API-first pipeline that acts as a "translation layer" between modern design environments and the Ovation platform.

1. **The Extractor (`1_asset_extractor.py`):** This Python script extracts data from a variety of engineering file formats (like CAD, GIS, and P&ID) and translates them into a single, structured, and open JSON format. This JSON serves as the "single source of truth."
    
2. **The Renderer (`3_svg_renderer.js`):** A front-end web component that uses the D3.js library to read the JSON data and visually render the plant graphics as a modern, interactive SVG file. This is where a designer's skills can be fully utilized.
    
3. **The Translator (`2_svg_to_ovation_translator.py`):** This is the core engine, a Python script that reads the SVG output and translates it into the proprietary Ovation `.src` file, complete with a clean, dimensionally accurate geometry.
    

**The Vision:** Juniper will free plant graphics from the constraints of legacy software, empowering designers and engineers to create dynamic, data-rich visualizations that improve operator safety, efficiency, and situational awareness. It is an open-source project that will foster a community of contributors who are passionate about modernizing industrial control systems.

### Your Marching Orders: Next Steps

Based on our discussions and the project's roadmap, here are your immediate priorities:

1. **Finalize the MVP (Minimum Viable Product):**
    
    - Ensure the `1_asset_extractor.py` script can reliably convert a simple CAD or GIS file (e.g., DXF or Shapefile) into the intermediate JSON format.
        
    - Verify that the `3_svg_renderer.js` component can accurately read and display all the information in that JSON.
        
    - Build a complete, working example that you can show to others, as outlined in "The Quick Win" phase.
        
2. **Launch the GitHub Repository:**
    
    - Create the repository with a clear `README.md` and the initial project files.
        
    - Include the demo assets so anyone can clone the repo and immediately see the project in action.
        
    - Explicitly state that the project is in a very early stage and that contributions are welcome.
        
3. **Produce the Launch Content:**
    
    - Record and edit the 90-second YouTube video. The focus should be on the compelling visual transformation from a static image to a dynamic one.
        
    - Prepare the posts for the Ovation Users Group website, leveraging the messaging we've developed for different audiences.
        
4. **Begin Community Engagement:**
    
    - Actively monitor the GitHub issues and discussion forums. Your presence and prompt responses are critical for attracting early contributors.
        
    - Start thinking about the first "easy win" feature for a new developer to work on and document it clearly.
        

Your main goal is to get a working, compelling demo into the public domain as quickly as possible. This will be the foundation upon which you build the community and secure the project's long-term success.
