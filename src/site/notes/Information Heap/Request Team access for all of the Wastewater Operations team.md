Hello,
Here at Maxson we are enhancing out digital documentation and communication.
All of our Wastewater Operations team should have access to Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint, and OneNote.

I believe that some of Wasterwater Operator Trainees have limited access.

For example, Dalvin Foster (dalvin.foster@memphistn.gov) is not able to log into Teams.
Dalvin Foster is also unable to make a Service Now request.

I can confirm that samuel.jenkins@memphistn.gov is able to log into Teams.

Permanent Operators include: 
gladys.nakayama@memphistn.gov 
samuel.jenkins@memphistn.gov  
stacy.bullard@memphistn.gov  
ivory.morris@memphistn.gov  

Trainees include:
dalvin.foster@memphistn.gov 
phoenix.cain@memphistn.gov 
kevin.a.smith@memphistn.gov 
terrence.beaman@memphistn.gov
