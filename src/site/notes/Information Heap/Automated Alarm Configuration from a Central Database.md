```
Whether you can configure alarm limits for sensors and probes using Ansible largely depends on the type of sensors/probes and the software or platform managing them.

## Key Considerations

### 1. What Sensors and Probes Are You Using?

- **Physical hardware sensors (e.g., environmental sensors, server hardware sensors):** These often require vendor-specific tools or agents.
    
- **Monitoring probes (software agents like Prometheus exporters, Nagios plugins, Zabbix agents):** These typically have configuration files or APIs that define alarm thresholds.
    

### 2. How Are Alarms Managed?

- If your monitoring system (e.g., Nagios, Zabbix, Prometheus Alertmanager) supports configuration via text files or APIs, Ansible can be used to push configuration changes or call APIs to modify alarm thresholds.
    
- Some sensors are configured through specific middleware platforms or cloud providers, which may also offer APIs or CLI tools Ansible can interact with.
    

## How to Use Ansible for Configuration

### Using Configuration Files

- Many monitoring systems have configuration files (YAML, JSON, INI formats) where thresholds and alarm limits are specified.
    
- You can use Ansible modules like `template` or `lineinfile` to manage such files and then restart the monitoring service.
    
```


Example snippet (simplified):

```yaml
- name: Configure alarm threshold for sensor probe
  template:
    src: sensor_limits.j2
    dest: /etc/monitoring/sensors.conf
  notify:
    - restart monitoring service

- name: restart monitoring service
  service:
    name: monitoring-service
    state: restarted
```

### Using APIs

- If your sensors/probes or monitoring platform provide REST APIs, you can use the `uri` module in Ansible to send HTTP requests to update alarm thresholds programmatically.
    

Example:

```yaml
- name: Update alarm limit via API
  uri:
    url: "https://monitoring.example.com/api/v1/alarms/{{ sensor_id }}"
    method: PUT
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer {{ api_token }}"
    body_format: json
    body:
      threshold: 75
      severity: warning
  register: result
```

### Vendor-Specific Modules and Collections

- Check if there are Ansible collections/modules for your particular platform (e.g., Cisco sensors, Dell OpenManage, HP iLO).
    
- These modules may offer native support to configure sensors or alarm limits.
    

## Summary

- Yes, you **can** configure alarm limits for sensors and probes using Ansible, **provided** the sensors or their management systems allow such configuration via files, APIs, or CLI.
    
- The process usually involves managing configuration files, invoking APIs, or using vendor-specific Ansible modules.
    
- For the best results, identify your sensor ecosystem and check if there are appropriate APIs or modules you can leverage with Ansible.
    
- Automating threshold changes via Ansible helps maintain consistency, speed, and version control in your monitoring configurations.
