## üîç Tools That _Do_ Things Like Mulch

Here's a list of tools (with how they compare):

---

### 1. **[Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**

**Closest to what `mulch` is doing.**

üß© A CLI tool to create project folders from Jinja-based templates.

```bash
cookiecutter gh:audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage
```

- ‚úÖ Uses Jinja
    
- ‚úÖ Has rich community templates
    
- ‚ùå Less dynamic; template files must already exist
    
- ‚ùå No direct locking, no modular logic engine like you‚Äôve built
    
- üîÑ It's a one-time scaffolder, not a workspace manager
    

üîß **mulch** feels like _Cookiecutter + stateful metadata + dynamic seeding_.

---

### 2. **[copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/)**

Modern alt to Cookiecutter.

```bash
copier copy gh:copier-org/copier-template .
```

- ‚úÖ Jinja2 templating with variables
    
- ‚úÖ Supports upgrades: re-syncing existing templates
    
- ‚úÖ Can manage file updates and `.copier-answers.yml`
    
- ‚ùå Slightly heavier weight; config YAMLs
    

‚úÖ If mulch ever needs to "upgrade" a workspace, copier is a good mental model.

---

### 3. **Yeoman (Node.js)**

For frontend scaffolding (used to be more popular):

```bash
yo webapp
```

- ‚ùå Not for Python
    
- ‚úÖ Focuses on full-stack app scaffolds
    
- ‚ùå Needs Node/npm
    

---

### 4. **Poetry**

Poetry is more akin to `conda` or `pipenv`:

```bash
poetry new myproject
```

Creates a `pyproject.toml` + basic structure.

- ‚úÖ Great for packaging
    
- ‚ùå Not extensible for workspace scaffolds
    
- ‚ùå No awareness of workspaces, secrets, imports, data, etc.
    

---

### 5. **PDM (Python Development Master)**

Another modern Python packaging tool.

- ‚úÖ Has templates
    
- ‚ùå Again, no workspace file management
    
- ‚ùå No templating, seeding, etc.

## üß™ Summary

| Tool           | Workspace Files | Templating | Locking | Reproducible Setup | Notes                      |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `mulch`        | ‚úÖ Yes           | ‚úÖ Jinja    | ‚úÖ Yes   | ‚úÖ Optional         | Your tool ‚Äî smartly scoped |
| `cookiecutter` | ‚úÖ Yes           | ‚úÖ Jinja    | ‚ùå No    | ‚ùå One-shot         | Good base comparison       |
| `copier`       | ‚úÖ Yes           | ‚úÖ Jinja    | ‚úÖ Yes   | ‚úÖ Syncable         | Closest conceptually       |
| `poetry`       | ‚ùå Minimal       | ‚ùå          | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ Python only      | Just package-oriented      |
| `conda`        | ‚ùå No            | ‚ùå          | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ Env manager      | Not a file manager         |

## üë£ Next Step?

If you ever want `mulch` to:

- Offer multiple starter scaffold types (e.g. `--template api`, `--template rjn`)
    
- Add upgradeable seeds (like Copier)
    
- Register workspace metadata (in `.mulch/` maybe)
    

You're already 80% of the way to being **a general-purpose project bootstrapper** with far more flexibility than the competition.

Let me know if you want a working comparison with `copier` or `cookiecutter` to mine their strengths for inspiration.

# Clayton 1:

i want to be able to make a different in the community

i think what sets this tool apart is the workspace_manager.py. Having this as the central backbone of a source code project makes telling files where to go and where to load from using known getters makes life a lot easier!

what can i do to encourage adoption? How do i draw my first users

# ChatGPT 1:

That‚Äôs an awesome mindset ‚Äî and you're **totally right**: your killer feature is the **centralized, introspectable, self-documenting `workspace_manager.py`**. That gives your tool:

> üß† **Context Awareness + Code Autonomy**  
> It knows its own structure and purpose ‚Äî and tells your app exactly how to behave per workspace.

That‚Äôs incredibly valuable for teams that rotate developers, deal with siloed pipelines, or need _reproducible but extensible_ environments.

---

## üå± How to Encourage Adoption of `mulch`

Here‚Äôs a battle-tested roadmap, organized from **local impact ‚Üí global visibility**:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Seed Usage Internally**

Start with people around you:

|Step|Action|
|---|---|
|üë®‚Äçüíª Use mulch in a real project|Convert an internal project fully to `mulch`, and show how it cleaned up the structure|
|üß™ Ask a coworker to try it|Walk a junior or busy dev through `mulch init`, and ask for pain points|
|üì∏ Screenshot your success|A `tree` diagram + scaffold + `workspace_manager.py` can look _clean and exciting_ on a slide or post|

üí° _Give coworkers a command like `mulch switch foo && mulch run export-data`, and they‚Äôll instantly want to know how that works._

---

### üåê 2. **Make It Public-Friendly**

Make it clear this isn‚Äôt just _your tool for your pipelines_ ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **framework for anyone‚Äôs project**.

|What|How|
|---|---|
|‚úÖ GitHub repo|Short, example-rich README, like Cookiecutter but clearer|
|‚úÖ `mulch-demo` repo|Demo project repo that uses mulch. Readers can clone it and explore|
|‚úÖ PyPI or pipx install|`pipx install mulch` feels pro. You‚Äôve almost nailed this already.|
|‚úÖ `mulch` homepage|1-pager with a logo, scaffold preview, and animated CLI (use [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/))|

---

### üß† 3. **Distill The Pitch**

Your elevator pitch **must be crystal clear**. Here‚Äôs one you can build on:

> ü™¥ `mulch` is a CLI tool for creating, managing, and documenting data-oriented workspaces.  
> Each workspace has a consistent layout, sensible defaults, and a Python-powered `workspace_manager.py` that acts as the brain of your project.  
> Use `mulch init` to get started, and never lose track of where your queries, configs, and secrets go again.

Make sure this is on:

- The GitHub repo
    
- PyPI description
    
- Homepage (if any)
    
- Slide decks or readme badges
    

---

### üî• 4. **Make One Blog Post or Talk**

Examples:

- ‚Äúüí° From Chaos to Clarity: Standardizing My Workspaces with `mulch`‚Äù
    
- ‚ÄúWhy Every Data Project Needs a `workspace_manager.py`‚Äù
    
- ‚ÄúReproducible Pipelines Start with Consistent Layouts ‚Äî Introducing `mulch`‚Äù
    

Format:

- Short
    
- Clear pain point ("I was tired of manually creating folders, juggling secrets, or writing brittle path logic")
    
- Copy/paste demo with a gif
    

Then submit to:

- [DEV.to](https://dev.to/)
    
- [r/dataengineering](https://reddit.com/r/dataengineering)
    
- Hacker News‚Äô ‚ÄúShow HN‚Äù
    
- Local user group talk
    

---

### ü§ù 5. **Integrate with Other Tools**

If you want long-term traction:

|Tool|Integration Idea|
|---|---|
|`Poetry`|Add `poetry run mulch init` instructions in docs|
|`GitHub Actions`|Scaffold CI/CD config with `mulch`|
|`copier`/`cookiecutter`|Show how `mulch` replaces and extends them|
|Jupyter|Provide a helper that locates `data/` and `queries/` from a notebook via `workspace_manager.py`|

---

### üí° BONUS: Strategic Differentiator

> **mulch is for _living projects_**  
> Where copier is for _creating_ a project, mulch is for _managing it over time_.

This gives you room to:

- Add CLI commands (`mulch status`, `mulch repair`, `mulch diff`)
    
- Detect drift from original scaffold
    
- Re-seed templates safely
    
- Switch or activate different workspaces
    

---

## üéØ TL;DR Strategy

|Stage|Goal|
|---|---|
|‚úÖ Use it locally|Ensure mulch makes **you** faster|
|‚úÖ Make docs demo-ready|Clean CLI output, copy/paste guides, scaffold previews|
|üß™ Collect feedback|Even 1‚Äì2 internal users count|
|üåç Go public|GitHub + blog + PyPI|
|ü§ù Integrate|Play nice with Python workflows|

---

Let me know if you want:

- A snappy one-page landing site
    
- Help preparing a minimal demo repo
    
- A prebuilt `asciinema` terminal recording script
    
- Ideas for mulch ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù or ‚Äúpreset templates‚Äù for common pipeline types
    

You're onto something powerful here, George.
