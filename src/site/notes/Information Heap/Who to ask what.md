Hi Clayton,
> 
> We’re looking forward to speaking with you tomorrow about the City of Memphis’s Hexagon CMMS and Asset Management approach. I’ll have several of our key team members on the call, and after meeting with them today, they shared some feedback and questions they thought would be helpful to circulate in advance.
> 
> These questions are simply to help guide our conversation and ensure we make the most of our time tomorrow. We certainly don’t expect to cover them all in detail during this first meeting. Also mentioned in our meeting is that you are using Stratham (sp?) a third-party vendor who assists with managing your CMMS. If you think they need to be part of the discussion tomorrow, that may be helpful or if possible, we can set up a 2nd meeting with them. 
> 
> General Project Context & Drivers
> 
> - What are the long-term organizational goals in this area? Is the focus on building a comprehensive asset management program or primarily on having a strong capital plan? (both - know plan for assets)
> - What efforts have been made in the past in this area? What worked well, and what didn’t?

Call Don
Coming in and doing a full inventory of assets, to enable us to know what we have and where to go from there.
Concern - we don't know what we've got.
The current asset list is missing a lot of items.
To set up PM's., and preventative.
Fund allocation years in advance.

> 
> Hexagon CMMS – Use & Effectiveness
> 
> - What aspects of Hexagon are working well, and what challenges are you experiencing? Are these primarily data structure/process issues, or more related to cultural/user adoption?
> - How do you currently use Hexagon to manage assets? Is it focused on fundamentals like work orders and tracking maintenance activities?
> - For assets not in Hexagon, how are maintenance activities tracked?
> - What is your general impression of the quality and completeness of data in Hexagon? Are you reporting on it, and do staff consider it accurate and up to date?
> - Is there existing documentation of workflows/business processes for entering data, tracking work, and managing asset information in Hexagon?
> - Is Hexagon usage required by leadership for all asset-related work and maintenance? How do you measure compliance and usage?

Krish, Monty, Diana

> 
> Specific Asset Management Questions
> 
> - Assuming this project gets kicked off, would you be able to provide a list of known assets at the Stiles plant?
> - Do you have asset hierarchies established for the various asset classes?
> 	- **Systems and positions**
> - Have likelihood of failure (LoF) and consequence of failure (CoF) parameters been established, for both vertical and linear assets? 
> 	- ***"Hexagon calls this Criticality"***
> 	- We have priority, based on day count.

> - Is there an existing asset management vision and policy in place?

Krish, Monty, Diana

> - What major infrastructure projects are planned at Stiles in the next 3–5 years? 
> - Does Memphis have a formal Asset Management Turnover process in place after Capital Projects are completed? (Nope: Mike)

Don, Derek

> 
> We’re excited to get into this discussion tomorrow and better understand your needs and goals. If there’s anything you’d like us to review before tomorrow, please feel free to share it.
> 
> See you tomorrow,
> 
> Rich


Krish:
The main challenge:
- If the technician is not putting it in properly, how will the foreman approve the work?
- The foremen need to be assigning the work


- Amount of data, organization of data, database opportuniites
- Fleshing out all available fields
	- Coordinates
	- Pictures
	- 
- Buy in and consistent use
	- Clarity of understanding
