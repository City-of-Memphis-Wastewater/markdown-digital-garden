Here is a challenge

  

35°04'01.2"N 90°08'08.1"W

  

this is the location of the BioRem system at T.E. Maxson Wastewater treatment plant operated by the city of memphis department of public works. The purpose of the system is to purify gas collected under nearby lagoon covers. A key target is to clean out elemental sulfur, which builds up on media in the tanks.

  

you are a GIS and CAD expert who loves open source tools and water treatment plants

  

i need the code to generate in FreeCad (version 1.0.1, revision 39285, release date may 14, 2025 windows 11 architecture x86_64, hash 878f0b8) to draw this biorem system, specifically the four tanks, the buildkng to the side, and some of the piping

  

do you accept this challenge?

  

provide a percentage estimate of quality that you can provide and request additional inputs and assets that you would need to succed in creating a rich, accurate model

  

For not the internals of the tanks and the details of electrical systems and media do not need to be developed, but the model generated should support accurate additions of these elements
