# CB 0

```
github.com/city-of-memphis-wastewater/mulch
and
pypi.org/project/mulch

this project is meant to make it easy to leverage variables for diffrerent projects and worksapces, by keeping workspace folders that are in a consistent hierarchy that can be chosen and swapped whenever you're working on a project

it is like a saved file, but it is multiple files, ascii encoded, and the schema is baked into the folder structure

i think sometimes this goal of saving complex work for different projects/workspaces is done with environmental variables

what are other typical Pythonic approaches?

```
In Python land, the problem you‚Äôre solving with `mulch` ‚Äî _persisting and reloading a whole ‚Äúcontext‚Äù for a project/workspace, not just a single file_ ‚Äî has a few well-trodden paths besides environment variables.  
Some of them are common in big frameworks, others are more lightweight patterns people roll themselves.

Here‚Äôs the landscape:

---

## **1. Environment Variables + `.env` Files**

- **Pattern:** Use environment variables to store configuration, optionally loaded from `.env` files (with `python-dotenv`).
    
- **Pro:** Works well for secrets, integrates with cloud/deployment workflows.
    
- **Con:** Flat key‚Äìvalue space, no schema enforcement, hard to store complex structures without serializing.
    
- **Analogy:** Like using sticky notes on your monitor ‚Äî quick and universal, but not structured.
    

---

## **2. Project Config Files (TOML, YAML, JSON)**

- **Pattern:** Store project/workspace settings in `pyproject.toml`, `config.toml`, `settings.yml`, or `settings.json`.
    
- **Pro:** Human-readable, hierarchical, schema-friendly (with `pydantic`, `voluptuous`, or `jsonschema`).
    
- **Con:** Doesn‚Äôt automatically set variables in memory; you still have to load them.
    
- **Example Tools:**
    
    - `pydantic-settings`
        
    - `dynaconf` (supports multiple envs + `.env` + JSON/TOML/YAML)
        
    - `confuse` (merging layered configs)
        
- **Analogy:** Like having a binder with tabs ‚Äî everything is organized, but you have to open it to find stuff.
    

---

## **3. Python Packages as Config Modules**

- **Pattern:** Store configs directly as Python modules (e.g., `myworkspace/config.py`).
    
- **Pro:** No parsing step, can use Python logic, can compute values dynamically.
    
- **Con:** Less portable (not language-agnostic), accidental code execution risks.
    
- **Example:** Django‚Äôs `settings.py` is basically this.
    
- **Analogy:** Like having a magic notepad that can fill in parts of itself.
    

---

## **4. Data Serialization for State Snapshots**

- **Pattern:** Save complex Python objects (dicts, classes) in formats like:
    
    - Pickle (`pickle`, `joblib`) ‚Äî fast, Python-only, not human-readable.
        
    - JSON/TOML/YAML ‚Äî human-friendly.
        
- **Pro:** Can persist ‚Äúcurrent state‚Äù as-is, easy to reload.
    
- **Con:** Pickle is unsafe if untrusted; JSON/TOML lose some Python-specific fidelity.
    
- **Example:** `mlflow` stores experiment runs with YAML/JSON metadata and folders of files.
    
- **Analogy:** Like freezing a whole workspace in amber and thawing it later.
    

---

## **5. Workspace/Project Management Systems**

- **Pattern:** Keep a _directory hierarchy as the schema_ (what `mulch` is doing).
    
- **Pro:** Files are modular, easily synced with Git, human-auditable, and easy to extend without migrations.
    
- **Con:** Schema lives in convention, not enforced by tooling unless you add validation.
    
- **Example Tools:**
    
    - Cookiecutter (scaffold once, not swap)
        
    - Pants, Poetry, Pipenv (do partial versions of this for dependencies)
        
    - `databags` / `metaflow` style runs
        
- **Analogy:** Like having a filing cabinet where the drawer labels are part of the rules.
    

---

## **6. Database-Backed Project State**

- **Pattern:** Store workspace state in SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.
    
- **Pro:** Queryable, transactional, works well for lots of small entities.
    
- **Con:** Heavy for local-only workflows; requires schema migrations.
    
- **Example:** Airflow stores DAG configs in a DB; ML metadata stores.
    
- **Analogy:** Like having a librarian instead of just folders.
    

---

## **Where `mulch` Fits**

`mulch` is most like **#5** but with some **#2** and **#4** sprinkled in ‚Äî it‚Äôs folder-driven, ASCII-friendly, and has a baked-in hierarchy so switching workspaces feels like swapping a saved game in a video game.

Where others just save a single config file or a few env vars, you‚Äôre bundling an entire _context_ ‚Äî code, settings, metadata, and potentially outputs ‚Äî into a predictable filesystem layout.

---

If you want to make `mulch` feel _even more Pythonic_, you could:

- **Integrate `pydantic` models** for validating the workspace folder structure and file contents.
    
- **Allow hot-swapping workspaces** with an env var override (so CLI + env workflows work together).
    
- **Support config layering** (default + per-workspace + per-user).
    
- **Expose a Python API** so devs can do:
    
    ```python
    from mulch import Workspace
    
    ws = Workspace.load("project_x")
    print(ws.paths.data_dir)
    ws.set_var("MY_SETTING", 42)
    ws.save()
    ```
    

---

If you want, I can map these approaches to _exactly how they‚Äôre typically implemented in Python CLI tools_ so you can see how `mulch`‚Äôs design compares. That‚Äôd make it easier to explain why your system is better for this use case.

```

```
Alright ‚Äî let‚Äôs compare **how people usually handle ‚Äúworkspace/project context‚Äù at the CLI level** across the approaches I mentioned, and then contrast with what `mulch` is doing.

## **CLI-Level Comparison of Project/Workspace Approaches**

|Approach|Typical CLI Commands|How Switching Works|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**1. Env vars + `.env` files**|`bash<br>export PROJECT=acme<br>export DATA_DIR=/mnt/acme/data<br>` or`bash<br>dotenv run python main.py<br>`|Change `.env` file or `export` values before running commands|Simple, portable, works in CI/CD|Hard to store structured data; multiple files need multiple vars|
|**2. Config file per project (TOML/YAML/JSON)**|`bash<br>python app.py --config projects/acme/config.toml<br>` or`bash<br>mytool run --workspace acme`|Pass a `--config` path or workspace name to load|Structured, supports nesting, readable|Need to remember path/name every time unless you alias|
|**3. Python config modules**|`bash<br>export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=mysite.settings.dev<br>python manage.py runserver<br>`|Change env var or symlink to the right `settings.py`|Dynamic configs, no parsing overhead|Language-specific, can‚Äôt easily share with non-Python|
|**4. Serialized state snapshots**|`bash<br>mytool load-state statefiles/acme.json<br>` or`bash<br>python resume.py --state acme.pkl<br>`|Point to a specific saved state file|Can store entire runtime context|Pickle can‚Äôt be diffed; JSON/YAML gets big & messy|
|**5. Workspace folder as schema (what mulch does)**|`bash<br>mulch switch acme<br>python mytool.py<br>` or`bash<br>mulch run acme mytool.py<br>`|`mulch` sets the current workspace and everything resolves relative to it|Self-contained ‚Äúbundle‚Äù of configs, data, scripts; easy to swap|Requires discipline to keep folder layout consistent|
|**6. Database-backed context**|`bash<br>mytool --workspace acme<br>` (queries DB for workspace vars)|CLI arg selects a row in DB; config is loaded into runtime|Centralized, queryable, multi-user safe|Overkill for simple local workflows|

---

## **CLI-Level Differences in Workflow**

Let‚Äôs imagine the workflow of switching from **workspace `acme`** to **workspace `memphis`** in each system:

**Env vars (.env)**

```bash
# acme
source projects/acme/.env
python run_pipeline.py

# memphis
source projects/memphis/.env
python run_pipeline.py
```

üëâ You‚Äôre swapping _variables_, not a folder structure.

---

**Config files (TOML/YAML)**

```bash
python run_pipeline.py --config configs/acme.toml
python run_pipeline.py --config configs/memphis.toml
```

üëâ You‚Äôre swapping _file pointers_, but the project layout stays the same.

---

**Python config modules**

```bash
export SETTINGS_MODULE=configs.acme
python run_pipeline.py
export SETTINGS_MODULE=configs.memphis
python run_pipeline.py
```

üëâ You‚Äôre swapping _imported modules_, but it‚Äôs all still in the same repo.

---

**Serialized state**

```bash
python resume.py --state states/acme.json
python resume.py --state states/memphis.json
```

üëâ You‚Äôre swapping _runtime snapshots_.

---

**`mulch` (folder schema)**

```bash
mulch switch acme
python run_pipeline.py

mulch switch memphis
python run_pipeline.py
```

üëâ You‚Äôre swapping an entire _world_ ‚Äî configs, data, scripts, metadata ‚Äî by changing the _root folder pointer_.

This is closer to a **saved game slot** metaphor than any of the others.

---

## **Why CLI-First Matters for mulch**

Most other approaches require you to **pass config each time** or set env vars every session.  
`mulch` can act more like:

```bash
mulch switch memphis
```

and _every subsequent command_ that depends on the current workspace automatically points to Memphis‚Äôs tree.

That‚Äôs a mental model users already know from:

- Git branches (`git switch`)
    
- Conda envs (`conda activate`)
    
- tmux sessions (`tmux switch-client`)
    

‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs faster than repeating `--config` or `source` every time.

---

If you want, I can **mock up a table that puts `mulch` side-by-side with Git branches and Conda envs**, because they‚Äôre the closest CLI metaphors ‚Äî and that would make your README click for people instantly.  
That comparison would really help pitch why `mulch`‚Äôs CLI design is ergonomic.
