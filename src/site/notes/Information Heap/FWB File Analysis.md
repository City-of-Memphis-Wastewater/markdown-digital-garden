1122.fwb

what is an fwb file?

MRU Optimax Probe, Calibration
mru-instruments.com

This device was recalibrated Diamond Scientific last year in 2024.

The device has a SD card. The only two files on it are a PDF of the most recent repair report with the certificate included. And also this 1122. fwb file, which has a binary encoding, as seen when i try to open it in notepad++.

Possibilities:
- cursor arts file wrangler: [FileWrangler â€“ CursorArts.com](https://cursorarts.com/ca_fw.html)
- **Fritzing Wire Bin**
- **Firewall Builder**: An `.fwb` file can be a configuration file used by Firewall Builder, a GUI for managing firewall policies.
- **Custom or proprietary software**: Some companies or tools use `.fwb` as a custom binary or project file format.
