Program update:
- 50% hydrogen peroxide 
![Pasted image 20250627120434.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250627120434.png)

- There is more sulfide than last year
- the current pump capacity is maxed out
- removing 1400 pounds of sulfide
- adding 3600 pounds of hydrogen peroxide
- 2.6:1 removal ratio - lower than expected

- [[People/Sammy Kohl\|Sammy Kohl]] says equipment can hypothetically dose up to 4300 gallons of hydrogen peroxide per day; we are currently maxed out at ~730 gallons per day
- 180 GPH/30 GPH * 730 gallons= 4300 gallons. The estimate is 1200 gallons per day could deal with the problem, based on the current efficiencies.
- Iron ([[Ferrous Chloride\|Ferrous Chloride]]) could be useful to mitigate issue at headworks
- Dan: What is the source of iron? is there a data sheet? Just pickle liquor?
- [[People/Chris Luss\|Chris Luss]]: We do not have information on percentage of ferrous chloride - information will be found.
- Sammy: Do we want to go down that road of installing a ferrous tank?
- Luss: Yes, probably, if Don approves. Might as well have it set up to go either way.
- Sammy: Access to free iron, then some balance of using both will be more cost effective. Will get with project manager to get a tank off of his hands and bring it to Maxson. Where will we put it specifically? How will we get bulk deliveries? At the headworks junction box would pose a challenge for getting a truck back there. 
- Chris: Simplest would be at the junction box - we would need to discuss what was needed. Closer to the bar screens is possible, but we would need to create a truck pathway or piping.
- Sammy and Dan Kile: Loading product from a truck takes 30 minutes to an hour. 
- Chris: It would be better if they could come in without opening the gate.
- Mike: Staying on the road might be problematic due to all the regular heavy truck traffic (from moving the old ABF filter media).
- Sammy: Would the area in front (east) of the [[Systems/BioAir\|BioAir]] 2 system be available for the ferrous chloride tank?
- Sammy: A starting point - the same pump size for Ferrous Chloride as the hydrogen peroxide. 3 gallons per minute, 4300 gallons per day. We do not have the capacity to use gravity or atmospheric pressure - control is necessary.
