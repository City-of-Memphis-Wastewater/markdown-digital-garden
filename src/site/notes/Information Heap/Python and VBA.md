You **can redistribute VBA**, but there are some important limitations and practical approaches. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

---

## 1️⃣ Redistributing VBA

VBA lives **inside Office documents** (Excel `.xlsm`, Word `.docm`, etc.). So distributing VBA usually means distributing the file itself, or embedding the VBA code into user files.

**Options:**

1. **Prebuilt workbook/add-in**
    
    - Create an `.xlam` Excel add-in or a `.xlsm` workbook with the VBA macros.
        
    - Users copy it to a location (e.g., `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\AddIns`) or open it directly.
        
    - Advantages: Easy, works with standard Office installations.
        
    - Limitations: Requires the user to **enable macros**, which Office will often warn about.
        
2. **Export/Import VBA modules**
    
    - Each VBA module can be exported as a `.bas` file.
        
    - Users can import it into their own workbooks manually.
        
    - Can be automated programmatically via COM (see below).
        

---

## 2️⃣ Automating VBA setup from Python

Python can interact with Office through **COM automation** (`pywin32`) to:

- Open a workbook
    
- Insert VBA modules
    
- Write VBA code
    
- Save the workbook or add-in
    

**Example: Adding a macro from Python**

```python
import win32com.client as win32

# Start Excel
excel = win32.Dispatch("Excel.Application")
excel.Visible = False

# Open a workbook (or create a new one)
wb = excel.Workbooks.Add()

# Add a module
module = wb.VBProject.VBComponents.Add(1)  # 1 = standard module

# Add VBA code
vba_code = '''
Sub RunPipelineEds()
    Dim cellVal As String
    cellVal = ActiveCell.Value
    Shell "powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command \\"poetry run pipeline query '" & cellVal & "'\\""
End Sub
'''
module.CodeModule.AddFromString(vba_code)

# Save as macro-enabled workbook
wb.SaveAs(r"C:\Users\george.bennett\Desktop\pipeline_macro.xlsm", FileFormat=52)  # 52 = xlsm
wb.Close()
excel.Quit()
```

**Notes:**

- Python requires **Excel installed** on the machine (desktop COM automation).
    
- `VBProject` access often needs **trusted access to the VBA object model** enabled in Excel’s Macro Settings.
    
- Users still must **enable macros** to run it.
    

---

## 3️⃣ Packaging for distribution

- You can include a **template `.xlsm` or `.xlam`** with your Python tool.
    
- Python installs the template in a user’s Documents or `%APPDATA%` folder.
    
- Your tool can optionally create a **shortcut or ribbon button** pointing to the workbook/add-in.
    

---

## 4️⃣ Security and limitations

- Office warns users when macros are present. There’s no way to bypass this safely.
    
- Some corporate environments disable macros entirely.
    
- COM automation can fail if Excel isn’t installed or the user lacks permissions.
    

---

✅ **In short:**

- VBA can be redistributed via **workbooks or add-ins**.
    
- Python can **automate installing or injecting VBA** using `pywin32` COM automation.
    
- Users must still **enable macros**, and Excel must be installed.
    
- True global integration (like “highlight text anywhere and right-click → pipeline-eds”) isn’t possible with VBA alone — you’re limited to Office.
    

---

A **Python workflow for installing a reusable Excel macro** works like this:

1. Copies a `.xlam` add-in to `%APPDATA%`.
    
2. Registers it automatically in the user’s Excel.
    
3. Creates the “Run pipeline-eds” right-click menu on cells.
    

This would let your Python CLI tool fully set up Excel integration.
