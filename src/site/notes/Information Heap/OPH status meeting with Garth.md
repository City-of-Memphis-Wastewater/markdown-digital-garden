The ball is rolling with SharePoint

Define a clear folder structure.


Have people with authority.

A folder structure that is based on process.


Take advantage of a SASS solution.
We need a governance team, to develop and steer the standards.
We are a Microsoft shoft
Power Platform.
Power Apps is baked in and IT will be much happier with it.
Have a Power App that deploys a folder structure to SharePoint for me. And it should easier than SPFx.


When including other people - use the low code for stability.

Henry has an expectation that WIMS will be the equivalent of a Historian. The Hach WIMS has no expectation of that. WIMS is not a regulatory reporting tool, but it can be used that way. 

My scripts will have access to the Hach WIMS SQL server.
