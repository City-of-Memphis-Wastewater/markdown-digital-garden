I am a Python developer as the only tech member of a team. Deploying smoothly and with low overhead is key. I think SharePoint may be more appropriate for our needs, rather than rolling out superuser Pythonic tools. If I want to build super user tools, it will be in SPFx i think

Your thinking makes a lot of sense from a pragmatic standpoint. SharePoint with SPFx can be an excellent choice for a solo Python developer who needs to deliver business solutions without the overhead of maintaining custom infrastructure.

**Why this approach works well for your situation:**

SharePoint provides the heavy lifting for user management, permissions, data storage, and hosting - things that would require significant setup and maintenance if you built custom Python applications. Your users already understand SharePoint's interface patterns, reducing training overhead.

**The Python-to-SPFx transition:**

While SPFx uses TypeScript/JavaScript instead of Python, the conceptual jump isn't too steep for a Python developer. You'll find familiar patterns in modern JavaScript - async/await, data manipulation, API calls, and component-based thinking. The Microsoft Graph API gives you programmatic access to SharePoint data that feels similar to working with REST APIs in Python.

**Low-maintenance superuser tools:**

SPFx web parts can create sophisticated interfaces for power users while leveraging SharePoint's built-in capabilities for data storage (lists), file management, workflows (Power Automate integration), and user permissions. You can build tools that feel custom but run on Microsoft's infrastructure.

**Hybrid approach:**

You could even keep Python for any heavy data processing or external integrations (running as Azure Functions or similar), while using SPFx for the user-facing interfaces that connect to those services.

This strategy lets you focus on solving business problems rather than managing servers, databases, and user authentication systems. It's often the most efficient path for small teams needing enterprise-grade solutions.
