# Eaton Medium Voltage Equipment Liability Training

## Overview
Medium voltage (MV)
- vacuum clad circuit breakers
- switchgear
- motor control

Disclaimer: These are cursory, non-exhaustive notes, with gaps in the subject matter and the syllabus.
## Interrupter Switch
Mechanical enclosed interrupter switch (MVS)
- A spring drives the speed and force to interrupt the load
- ionized gas is prevented from traveling phase to phase and then phase to ground
	- a flicker blade prevents arcing
- Maintenance is dictated by the number of current interruptions

Medium-voltage inspection keywords:
- Surface tracking
- Corona
- Conductive carbon trails

Materials:
- NORYL

Clean regularly to replace grease which can collect conductive dust (which can create a high resistance conductive opportunity). Use non conductive grease and grease that will not become glue-ish.

## Motor control
Medium voltage starters and medium voltage motor control: Ampgard
- Gradual increase to mitigate the risk of in-rush current

Low voltage (LV) components.

Materials
- Glastic: ("GlasticÂ® Grade 1494 is a fiberglass reinforced thermoset polyester material. It is available in sheet form as well as a wide selection of channel, angle, and tube sizes. These materials are the industry standard for flame and arc/track resistant electrical insulation.")
