Current situation:

History
- Trickling filter 5 was put into service in November 2024. Each trickling filter was put in at a different time.

Dustin Bosh: 
- Currently the entire weight of the system is resting on two bolts.
- Now we need to shore up or put dunnage under the barrel of the trickling filter, so that if (when) the remaining two bolts fail, it won't slam into the media and cause further damage.

Yaribell Hernandez ([[Contractors/CDM Smith\|CDM Smith]]):
- If the city needs assistance, CDM Smith offers subcontractor assistance to stabilize the situation

Next Steps:
- [[Max Foote\|Max Foote]] will come on site to add dunnage to the trickling filter arms at between 2/3 to 75% of their length, as indicated by [[Kevin Ball\|Kevin Ball]], presumedly of [[Contractors/WesTech\|WesTech]]. [[Information Heap/Maxson\|Maxson]] will not provide plant personnel to perform the assistance, as per the explicit direction of [[Information Heap/Tasha King-Davis\|Tasha King-Davis]] with support from [[People/Yaribell Hernandez\|Yaribell Hernandez]].
