*Hi Don/Mike/Chris, We will need Bar Environmental to change-out and calibrate 6 biogas flowmeters semi-annually during FY26. We may also need to purchase new flowmeters which could not be calibrated. The following is my cost estimate for these services in FY 26.*

*2 x $21,100 x 1.1 (10% increase) = $46,420 for calibration of 6 flowmeters semi-annually*

*2 x $3,350 x 1.1 (10% increase) = $7,370 for Bar to change out 6 flowmeters semi-annually*

*1 x $8,200 = $8,200 for a new 25.6” flowmeter*

*1 x 8,000 = $8,200 for a new 15.3” flowmeter*

*Total estimated cost is $69,990, which you could round up to $70K.*

*Please add this estimated costs to the other costs for Bar Environmental for FY26.*

*Thanks.*

*Henry Nakayama, P.E.*
