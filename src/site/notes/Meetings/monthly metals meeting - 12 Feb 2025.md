Look at particular parts of town
Phase 2: Loosahatchie Interceptor
- Explains Chromium
- Runyon cleans out train tanker cars, from vegetable oil.
	- Runyon is the largest contributor of zinc, for what is found in the Loosahatchie Interceptor
- Corovo Mining is a permit holder for industrial waste trade pond
	- Primary user of pond is Mitsubishi Chemical, who makes chemicals for batteries
	- Corovo makes acrylics and cyanide
	- Corovo's contribution explains 100% of copper in Loosahatchie interceptor, and a large portion of the 

Phase 3: Look at Wolf River Interceptor
- PMC Biogenics is a big contributor of Zinc

Phase 4:
- Compare Wolf River Interceptor with PennaChem
- Hypothesis: PennaChem is under-reporting nickel #bignews 
- Future: Look into Bartlett Industries as a source of metals (Sharp)

Summary:
- Side streams contribute ~17% of all four metals ; this is due to our capture rate of 80-85%
- Known industrial sources: Copper and zinc are largely unexplained


Look at these industries
- Van Gold
- KYG
- AY
- Memphis Cellulose
- PMC Biogenics
- PennaChem
- other
