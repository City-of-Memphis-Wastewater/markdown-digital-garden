[[Systems/Dewatering\|Dewatering]] belt press
- Modular design of the "G3"
- No requirement for flocculation mixer
- No electric motor for polymer distribution
- High pressure 12 roller design

Vocabulary
- "Chicane" (plows)
- Flingers

Models:
- Ashbrook Klampress
- **Winkle Press** (we have this one) - vertical section
- Gravity belt thickener ("Aquabelt")
- KPZ

Zones:
1. Gravity zone
2. low pressure zone
3. high pressure zone

Maintenance requirements:
- Daily cleaning
- Lift ploughs
- Turn the wheel daily on the wash box, lock to lock, to clean the nozzles. Uncleaned streaks on the belt indicate a clogged nozzle. It has brushes inside when are engaged and moved by turning the handle. 

Inspection:
- Even loading of feed.
- Inspect wear of chicanes/ploughs, ensure they are turning the sludge mass
- Ensure edge restrainer seals are contracting the belt. Replace or adjust seals as needed.
- Ensure scraper / doctor blades are functioning - replace as required. 
	- Upper and lower scraper blades are meant to rub the belt to remove sludge from the belt.
- Ensure belt wash system is cleaning
- Inspect wash box seals
- Inspect the dewatering belt - replace broken belt seam wires
- Max pressure 500 PSI, or even 300 PSI
- Ensure flingers are in place on the bearings
- Ensure the steering system is functional 
- Adjust polymer feed rate until flocculation is correct
- Adjust belt speed and tension
	- Range of belt speed is defined in percentage, from 0 to 100 %
	

Auto tensioning hydraulic system

Automated hydraulic guidance control
AS-H Belt Press G3 Belt Alignment - Where is the paddle and the cylinder? For the automatic hydraulic adjustment.

Dewatering zones
- Radial (low) pressure dewatering wedge zone (we have a vertical wedge zone)
- Full-pressure dewatering zone - pressure is increased as sludge passes through 8 to 12 rollers

Nozzles in the wash box - washes the belt before it starts again.
