# Design Team Proposal
- For [[Equipment/trickling filter towers\|trickling filter towers]] / ATF pipe repair solution
- Cost estimates
- Do we like it?

### Brian Hilts:
- What needs to be replaced?
- Replace the headers and valves that are exposed at the trickling filter pump station.
- Removal-and replacement of what is already there, using carbon steel piping, replacing like-for-like, what is already there.
- All the work will be above grade - even the pipe on the very west side of the station

- There will be no electrical work - just a piping and valve swap-out
- There are motor actuators on those vales, so they are automatically closed when the pump is offline. They will be replacing both the blue and orange values (see drawing).
- The light blue diverter valve, the light red piping, the blue and orange valves - all will be replaced. Coloring is for the purpose of this discussion to indicate what will be replaced.
- The intent is to leave the pipe supports - this will be revisited. Indicated below as "DEMOLISH PIPE SUPPORTS". [[People/Brian Stacks\|Brian Stacks]] says there is a lot of rust.

- [[People/Mike Brower\|Mike Brower]]: This drawing does not reflect what is being said. None of the below ground stuff will be worked on. Only what is exposed, above grade.
- [[Yari Hernandez\|Yari Hernandez]]: A new document will be provided that is accurate for the coming work.

- The approximate cost from a construction perspective is  ? 
- CDM Smith will get with the subs for proposals from them
## Craig Gadberry (CDM Smith) - Cost:
- Ductile cement mortar lining (10 million USD) - contrary to swap for swap
- epoxy lining (9 million USD) - contrary to swap for swap
- carbon steel (?) 

- Yari - we have money available under GMP 3 and GMP 4, but not the complete amount under a single GMP
- Purchasing of values under procurement can be in a 3 million dollar bin, release those materials under a change order to the sub, then releasing the change order to another sub
- Maybe 5 million plus 3 million dollars = 8 million total
- Dependent on PCO's
- [[People/Brian Hilt\|Brian Hilt]] asked Craig to check the price for carbon steel
