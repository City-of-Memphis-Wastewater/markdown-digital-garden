# External Influent Metals

![Pasted image 20250212130541.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250212130541.png)
![Pasted image 20250212130710.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250212130710.png)

Metals sampled: Zinc, Copper, Nickel, Chromium, Molybdenum
Sampling by City and by [[Contractors/Tioga Environmental\|Tioga Environmental]]

![Pasted image 20250212131014.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250212131014.png)


Look at particular parts of town
Phase 2: Loosahatchie Interceptor
- Explains Chromium
- Runyon cleans out train tanker cars, from vegetable oil.
	- Runyon is the largest contributor of zinc, for what is found in the Loosahatchie Interceptor
- Corovo Mining is a permit holder for industrial waste trade pond
	- Primary user of pond is Mitsubishi Chemical, who makes chemicals for batteries
	- Corovo makes acrylics and cyanide
	- Corovo's contribution explains 100% of copper in Loosahatchie interceptor, and large portions of the chromium and nickel

Phase 3: Look at Wolf River Interceptor
- PMC Biogenics is a big contributor of Zinc

Phase 4:
- Compare Wolf River Interceptor with PennaChem
- Hypothesis: PennaChem is under-reporting nickel #bignews 
- Future: Look into Bartlett Industries as a source of metals (Sharp, Olympus, Gyrus, Brim)

Summary:
- Side streams contribute ~17% of all four metals ; this is due to our capture rate of 80-85%
- Known industrial sources: Copper and zinc are largely unexplained


Look at these industries
- Van Gold
- KYG
- AY
- Memphis Cellulose
- PMC Biogenics
- PennaChem
- other

# Internal Plant Metals

Sampling at Stiles

![[Stiles Internal Metals Investigation_2.5.2025.pdf]]


A lot of metals are trapped in the lagoon.
Goal: cover more grit, get that to landfill
![Pasted image 20250212133919.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250212133919.png)

These metals get recirculated throughout the plant daily - 3 pounds of Chromium, 15 pounds of Copper, 5 pounds of Nickel, 67 pounds of zinc

# Maxson Plant

![Pasted image 20250212134712.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250212134712.png)

Key industries: 
- Richardson Oil
- Kelloggs
- Blues City Brewing
- Solae

Mysterious levels of Molybdenum in biosolids.

![Pasted image 20250212135039.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250212135039.png)
    ![Pasted image 20250212135100.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250212135100.png)

We need a higher frequency of zinc reporting from [[Industry/Solae\|Solae]] - at least monthly

Investigate these sources:
- Valicore
- Valero

Key take away: 
- Improved grit removal
- Higher frequency reporting from key industries

# Ammonia  - Gary Cohen
![Pasted image 20250212140708.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250212140708.png)

Maxson grit removal project - will there be money for it.
Alternative: Telling industries to cut back, and in terms of providing more than just data.
There is no chance of getting a grant right now, in terms of federal funds to do the work.

How do we make things more palatable for industry?
- Idea: An increased sampling requirement, with a sunset clause that it only applies for a year.
