## Reports:
### [[People/Ryan Stringer\|Ryan Stringer]]: 
- At [[Locations/M.C. Stiles Wastewater Treatment Plant\|M.C. Stiles Wastewater Treatment Plant]] there is a pre disinfection sensor issue
- Compressor issues due to cold weather. Condensation. They have been pulling compressors back to the office to do maintenance. Soon annual maintenance will come up, with full rebuild kits.
- At Maxson influent at splitter box, the sensor is passing function checks. There are drops in measurements that correlate with cleaning: ![Pasted image 20250220130808.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250220130808.png)
- More stringy material is getting stuck in the carbolizer ![Pasted image 20250220130856.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250220130856.png)
- Maxson post disinfection has a sample pump on order. There is a Con::Cube issue![Pasted image 20250220130937.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250220130937.png)
- Con::Cube and probe are passing function checks, but the compressor is not effective at cleaning. ![Pasted image 20250220131007.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250220131007.png)
- Maxson Pre-Disinfection:![Pasted image 20250220131039.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250220131039.png)
- Hach analyzer vs [[Contractors/Hach\|Hach]] probe - the analyzer includes reagent #reagent #analyzer 
- All [[Industry/Evonik\|Evonik]] signals are coming into the [[Software/Emerson Ovation\|Emerson Ovation]] System
- Working on calibration for grit tank accuracy![Pasted image 20250220131745.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250220131745.png)
- Compressor issues for BOD and COD at grit tank - the screens can get contaminated when they're not being blown out regularly. A piece of grit got jammed into a piece of equipment.![Pasted image 20250220131814.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250220131814.png)

### [[People/John Abrera\|John Abrera]]: 
- BOD is typically a subset of COD

### [[People/Don Hudgins\|Don Hudgins]]:
- Something hit the plant hard from February 2 to Feb 7 - asked [[People/Derek Willis\|Derek Willis]] to investigate industry
### [[People/Peter Gabor\|Peter Gabor]]:
- Great report of Ovation gaps and improvements - a lot of disinfection sensors are bonked.
- Radio spec
- EDS Portal opportunities
## Action Items
- [x] Meet with [[People/Jon Watson\|Jon Watson]] about Maxson PAA sensor mentioned in meeting - clarify with [[People/Don Hudgins\|Don Hudgins]], make project similar to what Don has been tracking at Stiles
