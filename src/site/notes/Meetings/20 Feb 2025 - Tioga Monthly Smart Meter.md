- At [[Locations/M.C. Stiles Wastewater Treatment Plant\|M.C. Stiles Wastewater Treatment Plant]] there is a pre disinfection sensor issue
- Compressor issues due to cold weather. Condensation. They have been pulling compressors back to the office to do maintenance. Soon annual maintenance will come up, with full rebuild kits.
