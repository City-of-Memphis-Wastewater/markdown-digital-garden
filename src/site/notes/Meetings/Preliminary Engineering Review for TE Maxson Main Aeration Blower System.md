This meeting will primarily discuss electrical issues.

There in the conference room (Fine Bubble Diffuser people)
- EDI
- Next Turbo
- E-Tech

The main goal today is to start and stop blowers.

[[People/Gary Garrison\|Gary Garrison]]'s History and Status Rundown
- We have 6x 1500HP blowers
- Installed in 1969
- "TWAC"
- Radiators were removed later, so now there are TWAC air cooled
- Over the years we have added a couple of air cooled motors.
- Electrical system starter - reduced voltage, two pole, auto transformers.
- There have been issues with blowing up the auto transformers.
- The control system is about 400 feet from the system itself, so you don't know what is happening at the bucket.
- If there is a fuse blown, there have sometimes been a single-pole start.
- Lately: Across the line start
- Vacuum interrupters. Cutler Hammer <-- (Original) Westinghouse IQ's. 
- Schweitzer equipment (7/10-5)
- It would be nice to have a soft start system. Eaton Soft Start. This would be more reliable than the vacuum interrupters.
- Bentley Nevada Machine Health System (1970's style), monitoring standalone - not connected to Ovation system. Monitors motor RTD's.
- Updated machine health wishlist
	- Differential pressure, see when the air filters are dirty
	- Vibration monitoring
	- Turnkey DCS system
	- Motor bearing temperature

The boys from [[Contractors/Gresham Smith\|Gresham Smith]] (Sid Hamby, Craig Parker, and Jason Carroll) will bullet point the immediate scope.
