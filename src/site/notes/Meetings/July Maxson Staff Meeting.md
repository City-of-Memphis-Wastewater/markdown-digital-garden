# Safety Professionals meeting
[[Ronald Robertson\|Ronald Robertson]] and [[Valdez Hall\|Valdez Hall]] will attend a luncheon for safety professionals.
# Violations
We have had 59 violations in July.
Why?
- Shut down south side of aeration tanks, to attempt to fix south side clarifier valve.
Shannon will be here on Thursday to drain the crossover channel while they pull the valve.
The valve has already been purchased.
Don: Are we just replacing one valve, or are we doing any preemptive maintenance while we are shut down?
Don: Aren't there two valves there, to isolate each outlet?
Mike: We replaced 3N influent valve.
Chris: Right now everything is being sent through the north side. The issue is the crossover valve.
Don: We need a way to isolate every tank. Stop lock, to isolate every tank, to not worry about the crossover channel.

# Laboratory
Remaining annual samples should be on the July DMR report.

# Contract review
Open purchase orders: ![Pasted image 20250805082108.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250805082108.png)

Don will forward Chris a bunch of BNC's that got kicked back. Chris will work it out with Stephanie.

Chris: We are paying $118k for computers in the dewatering facility. These are for troubleshooting and controlling 
Don: These could have been bought with money from the contingency budget.
Chris: Who is over that now?
Don: Tasha. No proposal was retrieved.

# Power usage

Some blowers were turned off, and this is primarily why there is variation in power usage.

# Rainfall
We averaged 55 MGD throughout the month.

# MMOR

Don: Technically this is Harvey's jurisdiction.
Don: What is going on with the course bar screens.
Gary Young: We are using them, there is no issue with them now.
Don: What about the raw sewage pumps?
Gary: We are waiting 5 to 6 weeks for Motion Industries to send us the mag for raw sewage pump 1. We have used raw sewage pump 2, though it did trip out earlier in the month.
Gary: Number 3, we are waiting on parts. Gary has ordered those, though we do not have an ETA.
Gary: Originally raw sewage pump number 4 was water-cooled but now it is air-cooled. They have drilled some holes in it for air flow. It was converted a long time ago. It was tripping out because it wasn't getting enough air. More holes were added for more air. 
Don: Thanks. Please tell us about the fine bar screens.
Gary Young: They are good.

Hood: 3 and 5 ABF pumps, we are waiting on Xylem to send them back. Number 6, we are in the process of rebuilding. the rest are up.
Hood: Screw pumps 1 we are waiting on concrete to be repaired at the bottom. 3, the concrete at the top needs repaired. 4, the screw assembly twisted off.
Hood: We have two RAS blowers running. One of them is down on vibration. The north blower is down, and we are waiting on piping.

Don: Are RAS blowers covered under warranty?
Gary Garrison: Yes, for one year.

Rodney Williams: All of the presses are running

# Monthly Statistics
![Pasted image 20250805090057.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250805090057.png)
 
- [ ] Talk to Gary Garrison about the new probe points that need to come into Ovation.  
We need a new probe to come in from the pump building to ovation for a new probe from Trinova. Aeration basin meters are coming in.

Calculate aggregation numbers for the various basins, in Ovation totalizer.

623 work order.
Total number of probes and sensors inventoried at the plant right now: 40

D.O. data is coming into Ovation.

71 dry tons generated.

710 assets are in Hexagon.
# CMAR
- Completion at the end of this year.


# Biogas numbers for June
Biogas volume: 16.3 million cubic feet flared.
SO2: 2.85 mcf flared.

# Biogas numbers for July
Biogas volume: 11.0 million cubic feet flared.
SO2: 2.33 mcf flared.


Don: Why are our biogas numbers low? 
Chris: We have been struggling to waste, to keep our biosolids in the plant. The mixed liquor never really bounced back. We were wasting primary sludge.
