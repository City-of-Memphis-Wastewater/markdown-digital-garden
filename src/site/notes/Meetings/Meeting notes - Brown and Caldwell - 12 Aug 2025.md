- Monty Gowans
- Krishna Bejjanki

History
- MP2 to Hexagon data dump
- Initial dump, and then organized and uploaded
- Rethinking of asset definitions - there was an unclear understanding of assets, positions, and systems.

Next steps
- More metadata (like voltage, size, geolocation)
- Adding undefined assets (like the cracking pipe gallery floor)
- Clarifying jargon, in terms of organization (asset vs system vs position)
- Transferred assets from MP2 might be misassigned to a hierarchy properly

Monty
- "The structure is good. The problem is unclear definition"
- We know for sure, some equipment is not identified, so the structure is incomplete.
- There is utility in trying to change existing positions.

Clayton:
- How can we define things in a way that is relatively referenceable, extensible, and less fragile?
- NFC and QR code tagging, etc. To reference a unique identifier for each asset / element.

Benjamin Swain:
- We have a client like this now.

Christopher F.
- Are subcomponents tracked as assets?
- How granular do you get?
- Ex: VFD, motor, as a part of a pump.

Monty:
- Individual assets like the VFD and Motor and pump are meant to roll up into a whole system, like a pump system
- Buy in a key issue.

Christopher P:
- Is the key problem around organization confusion?

Monty:
- No, the key problem with buy in has been inconsistent Android app updates for EAM Offline. This has caused confusion.
- At Stiles the PM's are more consistent
- Management changes.
- Monty wants to get us back into being familiar

Chris F:
- Has Hexagon been providing support for the EAM Offline App?

Monty:
- Yes
- The real problem has been the City not being able to push consistent updates, only when it is needed
- A version change at the will of the technician per tablet is causing inconsistency
- [[Andre Armstrong\|Andre Armstrong]] and [[People/Krishna Bejjanki\|Krishna Bejjanki]] can submit tickets for fixes.
- Identifying asset criticality (LoF vs CoF)

Benjamin:
- Does the city have an existing asset management plan?
- "Asset management maturity evaluation" is something we can too
- Guardrails
- What is the primary driver?

Chris Luss:
- We want to get ahead of the problem.

Chris F:
- Lof and CoF
- Strong analytical case for CIP

Bryan
- Grouping several project together that are related
- Put in to place a LoF and the rehab-replace logic
- Which assets are run-to-fail (replace)
- Versus a pump, which is tear down and rebuild, and you know ***when***
- Rehab can qualify as CIP
- Failure modes and effects analysis - can be tracked with Hexagon
- Are you using Power BI?

Krish
- We have visuals within Hexagon
- We want to use Power BI
- [[Cognose\|Cognose]] report writing tool, for reactive work orders vs planned work orders

Monty
- Hexagon allows for easy integration with Power BI

Chris F
- Time spent per work order, is that being collected.
