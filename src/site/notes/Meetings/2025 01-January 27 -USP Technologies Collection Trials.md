Goals:
- Mitigate [[FailureModes/Hydrogen sulfide\|Hydrogen sulfide]] production between industry, interceptor, and headworks. This can be achieved by maintaining a neutral pH. As the wastewater flows towards the plant, pH tends to drop, increasing the tendency for elemental sulfur to convert to hydrogen sulfide.   


Keywords:
- Caustic shocking



Key question:
- What is the ideal interval for caustic shocking?

People:
- Michael Fagan
- Sammy Kohl
- Michael Ratley

Get pH higher to mitigate corrosion, then hit it with peroxide for headworks

Remove sulfur in influent.
