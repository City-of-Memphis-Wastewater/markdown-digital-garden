Clayton's Notes:

```
I spent some time talking to colleagues this weekend with similar digital integration issues and successes at various organizations. 

Opinions:

- Upvotes for Teams
- Downvotes for OneNote
- Upvotes for Blazor forms to replace spreadsheet data inputs
- Upvotes for having an IT discovery team come on site to discuss opportunities
- Upvote for a dedicated operator workstation with an IP address that has write privileges to a server on the intranet, instead of requiring a personal log in for write privileges. 

If y'all have the bandwidth for a full scale project, we would love to get someone in IT on site to discuss needs with our Operations team. 

The easy answer is to ask the operations team to put their notes in OneNote, with operator accounts having write privileges. But feedback says that OneNote organization can get messy quickly.

I'd like to identify a solution that is smooth for everyone and right the first time.
