Key concerns are:
- Metals
	- molybdenum
	- lead

A citizen asked
- How will legislation be used to hold companies accountable retroactively

During environmental investigation
- TVA installed deep borings
- U of M CESAR performed drawdown / breach tests
- Hydraulic containment was identified as an issue, with downward migration
- U of M has research on breaches in the region (a la [[Sarah Houston\|Sarah Houston]])

Sarah Houston
- Have breaches been identified on the West Ash Disposal Area?
- TDEC: There is a thick clay layer (~100 ft) there, so TDEC gladly reports that there are no breaches in that area.

# TVA Allen Fossil Plant - Ash Disposal Presentation

### Focus:
- Ground water
- Determine if the clay layer is competent

### History:
- All coal ash has already been removed
- The commissioners order: OGCIS-0117
- The EPA implemented the TDEC approved plan
- TDEC accepted the environmental assessment report, and the EPA then issued recommendations.

### Abbreviations
EIP - Environmental Investigation Plan
ROD - Record of Decision
CBR - Closure by removal
IRA - Interim response action
WADA - West Ash Disposal Area
CARA - Corrective action / risk assessment 

### Findings 
- There is a fluctuation of the ground water
- MCL's (standard exceedances)
	- Moly
	- Arsenic
	- Lithium
	- These exceedances are only among 6 wells, and are lower in the west than in the east
- Modeling by attenuation is feasible, but it will require more data than has been collected thus far
- Install recovery wells on the north side, over time.

### The Care Plan
- All actions that TVA will take at the site
- They must list the methods of reaching the goal
- TVA must provide a schedule
- Ground water extraction with an eye on ground water protection standards
- The source material has been removed, there is no risk of further contamination.
- TVA will implement adaptive management.
	- Install treatment system
	- Monitor ground water, for concentrations changing over time - so that dynamic decisions can be made at a short time scale.
	- If concentrations naturally attenuate, we will be able to shorten the necessary life span of the system.
- Statistically improved performance must be demonstrated, to be below the ground water protection standard.
	- Quarterly ground water sampling
	- For several years, to have enough data to truly determine.
