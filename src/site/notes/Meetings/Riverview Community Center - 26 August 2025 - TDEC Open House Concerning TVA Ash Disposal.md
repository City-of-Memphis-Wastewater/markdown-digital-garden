Key concerns are:
- Metals
	- molybdenum
	- lead

A citizen asked
- How will legislation be used to hold companies accountable retroactively

During environmental investigation
- TVA installed deep borings
- U of M CESAR performed drawdown / breach tests
- Hydraulic containment was identified as an issue, with downward migration
- U of M has research on breaches in the region (a la [[Sarah Houston\|Sarah Houston]])

Sarah Houston
- Have breaches been identified on the West Ash Disposal Area?
- TDEC: There is a thick clay layer (~100 ft) there, so TDEC gladly reports that there are no breaches in that area.
