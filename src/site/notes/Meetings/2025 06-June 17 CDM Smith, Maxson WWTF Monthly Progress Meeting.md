# WesTech / Trickling Filters
[[Contractors/WesTech\|WesTech]] remote adjustments on trickling filters.

Pump #10 was not turned on. Flow is still being adjusted for the trickling filters #2 and #3. #3 was turned on this morning. #2 has been in service over the weekend.

"Joe" is coming for sampling on Thursday. The Valve on TF 1 is stuck at 60% open, because there isn't enough flow to adjust the speed.

There will be a restart of TF#1 for testing, to start on Thursday.

Tristate did troubleshooting yesterday on speed sensor wiring - a twisted pair has been installed backwards.

Time to start double checking the landings in the DCU.
