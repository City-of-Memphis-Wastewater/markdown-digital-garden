	- Key question: How do we best mitigate sulfide coming into the headworks?
	- Systems survey and discussions with Don, Henry, Mike, and Noah.
	- Peroxide could be added to reduce hydrogen sulfide to reduce vapor sulfide to reduce corrosion.

Sammy: The goal is to neutralize it at the lift station but ultimately through the force main.
 A drop in pH that is this significant, so the biofilm must be significant. The goal is to chip away at the biofilm, so that it has less of an impact downstream.
 Monitor this discharge point to see day over day what is the pH doing.
 Upon shocking the water we would expect the hydrogen sulfide levels to dip down, because we're trying to get the pH levels above 10 in the force main.
 
 Robert: What will this do to the pumps?

Sammy: A rigid application point will feel directly into the water. If there is a concern about the elevated pH and the pumps, we should discuss it before putting it into the lift station.

Robert will check some pump data.

Tasha King-Davis is concerned about high pH in the lift station. Historically, basic (high) pH has been eating away at railing and at pumps.

Sammy: The goal is to get the high pH water through the lift station quickly. Was the former problem acute or long-exposure?
