Henry, key issues:
- Packing clean
- spin up healthy balance
- electronics stability: automation and data collection failure

Clayton: How often does packing need to be cleaned?
- Monthly

[[Lorde and Company\|Lorde and Company]] will have to come out to and automate the [[Systems/BioRem\|BioRem]] system. 

We want a say in the [[jargon/consent decree\|consent decree]], which is coming anyways - the sooner the better.

Maggie:
- How long does it take to replace a SWG 100?
- Can it be done by people in house?

Henry:
- We can have [[Contractors/Diamond Scientific\|Diamond Scientific]] people visit, or we can ship them equipment.

The [[SWG100 gas analyzer\|SWG100 gas analyzer]] plan clarity will help a lot.

Shelby County doesn't like the normalized use of handheld analyzers.

--- 

- Clean each BioRem monthly, cyclically
- BioRem is undersized: we might need more units.
- Standarzied media cleaning process with dedicated equipment - 
	- The recommended media cleaning process causes the nozzles to go awry.
	- Compressions causes the media to smack the nozzles.
		- Remove the nozzles each time 
		- Add protective cages around the nozzles - one and done.
		- Use conveyance to remove the media to physically, like surfactants, which might impact the biological treatment.

- Compression.


What is a [[jargon/consent decree\|consent decree]]?

---

Software component: Hexagon system.
- Swapping out the SWG100 every 6 months, with Diamond Sci
- Switching out the flow meters every 6 months, with Barr Environmental
- Use Tioga for reporting

These contracts allow for stability.

What metrics will we be judged on?
How often will we have deadlines?
- Have plans in place by certain time.
