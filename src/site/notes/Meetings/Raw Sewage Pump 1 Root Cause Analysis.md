# Introduction to the pump, motor, and clutch (mag drive)
Installed in 2002.
1200 horse vertical.
Manufacturer: E+H of Minneapolis, MN.
WEG acquired E+H and basically let them die.

# Corrective maintenance program
- Chris Luss: Kim Crawford said every six months
- Chris Luss:  It was being done, but then it has been consistently breaking. 


# How long has # 1 been effectively out of service?
## Sewer Line Failure (2015)
- Don: Was raw sewage pump # 1 part of that pumping?
- Mike: Yes, it was. Because 2 and 3 were being installed at the time.
- Mike: We ran 3 pumps in 2015
## Sewer Line Failure (~2 years ago, April 2023)
- Don: Was raw sewage pump # 1 part of that pumping?
- Mike: Not sure.
- Chris: I think we were using # 2 and # 3, and then sometimes # 4 when necessary.
- Don: How long has # 1 been effectively out of service?

## Clarity, Mike

- It hasn’t run since at least January 2024
## Now
- Wait until the Mag comes back from being rebuild externally
- The pump was rebuilt in house, about two weeks ago, to replace the shaft

## When the plant was built
- Mike # 4 was a fixed speed, induction motor. Has not changed.
- Flow matcher control system as used for # 1, # 2, and # 3. Allis Chalmers, GE. The electrolyet
## 2000
- Mike: # 1 was changed to a magnetic drive. To increase the HP on the motor and to increase the pumping capacity
- Brand new, it would pump 70 MGD all day long
- Ran well until about 2002 or 2003, with basic PM's
- It was taken out and rebuilt in the early 2000's
# Until 2015
- Parts could no longer be found for the old flow matcher system, so # 2 and # 3 were converted away from this in 2015.
- It was a goal to increase the pumping capacity and HP of # 2 and # 3, to 70 MGD each, so the bases for pumps, the motor, and the drives (VFD's) were rebuilt/enhanced/changed. The VFD's is why we have the HVAC building. 
## Now
- Mike: As we speak (July 2025), # 3 is being diagnosed by a technician from Eaton, who manufactured the VFD's.
- Don: Do we need any upgrades for # 3? Is it under a PM program? 
- Mike: I think Chris wants to replace the whole thing. 
- Don: Did we miss any opportunities, for monitoring or a maintenance program with Eaton? Did we follow factory recommendations?
- Chris: Yes, we have been involved with them. But not the system is becoming outdated, and the parts are not able to be found anymore. [[People/Gary Garrison\|Gary Garrison]] has been doing the maintenance on the VFD all along
- Don: The other pumps, are they due for maintenance?
- Chris: 2 was taken out to redo the packing, leaving us with 4. And then 4 was taken out for PM / repacking, leaving us with 2. And then they both went out. 4 caught fire after the PM.
- Mike: 2 needs work on the speed control and on the stuffing / packing box on the pump itself. It is leaking from the stuffing box, we think. Once we get another one going, it will need work.
- Don: Why can we not keep three pumps in good shape at all times?
- Chris: That was the case for a while.

# Goals
- We should have three pumps available at all times
- Pump 1 took too long to figure out
- We always need three pumps when it rains


# Rebuilds
## 4
- Number 4 motor, which caught on fire, has similar 
- Can they rebuild the spare once the parts are taken out?
- Has been a fixed speed pump the entire time.
## 1
- Mike: Changes are that something got into 1 and caused it to vibrate and caused it to fail.
- Chris: 1 is top heavy.
- Don: if they redesign it, can they put in a more modern motor
- Chris: [[Harvey Woodall\|Harvey Woodall]] wants to step down the power on that motor.
- Mike: 2 and 3 are also both 1200 HP. 1,2,3 have always been variable.
- Clayton: Was 70 MGD over zealous when the 700 HP motors were all upgraded to 1200 HP.
- Chris: The mag systems don't have to be air condition cooled. Consider throwing away the VFD's. On 2 and 3.
- Don: The base is a totally different geometry. 
- Clayton: We don't want to introduce vibration problems if we change 2 and 3 to mags
- Chris: Let's look at Stiles and see how it is set up.
## Screen system
- Chris: When the water is high, mass gets past the screens and into the pump, and can cause damage.
- Mike: It has always been that way.

# Pumping around the Pump Building
- Mike: There is a change you would have to bypass the pump building and redo the whole thing
- Headworks Piping is in the dry well in the pump station
- The pumps 2 and 3 were done (2015) after the headworks piping was redone (2011)
- Chris: A gate would be useful to close so that
