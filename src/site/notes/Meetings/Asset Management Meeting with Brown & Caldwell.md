# Intro
- Key interest: Condition and consequence to inform an R&R plan

[[Rich McGillis\|Rich McGillis]] specializes in water and sewer. The regional manager for "utility performance".


# Louisville
Louisville, KY had a consent decree to negotiate asset management into their amended CD.
Quality quality and pump stations needs to improve.
Define:
- How to assess their assets
Taking inventory:
- Looked at every vertical asset
- five regional plants
- two larger plants
- 290 pump stations
Key questions:
- What are the most critical assets?
- What should you spend on in the future?
- What is the process of capturing data to enable you to make better decisions?


There are some legal aspects here. Jargon:
 - "CIP"
 - "CD"

Louisville's big problem
- Labor limited. 
- Were not optimizing the visualization of the data


Henry: how did you determine the critical assets?
Anne: consequences, likelihood of failure.

They sure do like Power BI.

"rehab and replacement"

11 months, 50k assets.

# Presentation review: What did we like?

Don: Impressed with wastewater specific approach, rather than just sewers and manholes.
Chris: Yay, less work.
Don: We were impressed with the 20 year spending plan.
	- Long lead times have been problematic for us.
	- The city should have planning in the CIP area
	- We need outside help t put together bid packages
	- Inventory all of the assets - does it make sense to coordinate bids
	- Enable our own 20 year forward-look
	- Use CIP budget rather than plant operating budget

Louisville has to spend a certain amount every year due to their CD
