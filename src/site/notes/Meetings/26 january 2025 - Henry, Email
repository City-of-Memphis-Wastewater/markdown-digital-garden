  **Hi Clayton, your Obsidian map and nodes shows you have been doing a lot of reading on subjects that are germane to plant operations, issues, and future upgrades. I went on a few of your trails, and I have the following comments.**

  **Tertiary treatment could include [[vocabulary/disinfection]], but we like to reserve the term, “[[vocabulary/tertiary treatment]]” to nutrient reduction #nutrientreduction, and leave [[vocabulary/disinfection]] as its own category.**

  **It was interesting to read about the [[vocabulary/Beixiaolu wastewater membrane reactors]], which uses polymer tubing, very much like [[vocabulary/dialysis]], except it operates in the opposite direction as dialysis. But, it is in the same principle for membrane reactors, where a [[vocabulary/filter membrane]] is used to concentrate pollutants (food, nutrients, and solids) to reduce the wastewater treatment volume by perhaps 90%, which would greatly reduce the [[vocabulary/reactor tank]] size and cause the bugs to be more efficient due to the high concentration of food and nutrients, and possible more solids to provide substrate for the bugs to attached themselves too, which they prefer. The downside is that any toxins would be concentrated, which could inhibit or kill the bugs. The [[Industry/XAI]] use of [[vocabulary/ceramic filters]] for the [[vocabulary/graywater plant]] will be using the same treatment principle.**

  **They also use [[vocabulary/hydrolysis]] to treat sludge, which is usually using either acid or [[vocabulary/caustic]] under high pressure and heat to break down food waste. The acid would breakdown [[vocabulary/starches]] and [[vocabulary/cellulose]] into sugars, and the caustics would breakdown fats, oil and greases into soap and [[vocabulary/glycerin]].** # goodtrade

  **I saw the article on [[vocabulary/ultrasonic treatment]] of [[vocabulary/industrial wastes]], which uses high energy and high frequency sound waves to produce and implode microscopic bubble, which blast solids into smaller particles. The smaller particles would be less chunky for the bugs to adsorb and digest. There is another technology, which is somewhat similar, which is the [[vocabulary/nanobubble]] generation and treatment. I wondered if the bubble were similarly generated. It turns out that [[vocabulary/nanobubbles]] #nanobubbles are much smaller than bubble produce by ultrasonic, and are produce using ceramics with nanometer-diameter holes. Also, nanobubble are not imploded as with the ultrasonic treatment system. Nanobubbles are less than 1 micron in diameter, and can remain in solution from hours to months due to Brownian Motion. They have some of the highest oxygen transfer rates due to their very high surface to volume ratio, and they contain very high potential energy due to the extremely small surface curvature, which cause extremely high surface tension. When they do pop, the kinetic energy released is powerful enough to break chemical bonds of fatty acids and [[vocabulary/surfactants]].**

  **[[vocabulary/Ferric salts]] are used to treat lower levels of sulfur from biogas and for odor control. But is not used for higher concentrations of sulfur in biogas, because the reaction of sulfur to the ferric salt is highly [[vocabulary/exothermic]], and the medium used to provide the ferric salts with high surface area is wood chips. So, columns or tanks filled with wood chips coated with ferric salts have combusted when attempting to treat biogas with high sulfur levels.**

  **Glad that you have been doing an abundance of research, and are putting the information into your Obsidian program.**
