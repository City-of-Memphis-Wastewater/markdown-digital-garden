|Date|Time|O2 [%]|CO2 [%]|H2S dil. [ppm]|CH4 [%]: Currently seen in [[Equipment/SWG100 biogas analyzer\|SWG100 biogas analyzer]] SD card data.

Historically seen, but not late.y: |Net cal. val. [MJ/m³]|Gross cal. val. [MJ/m³]|T-sensor [°F]|Balance N2 [%]|Net BTUs [btu/cf]|Gross BTUs [btu/cf]|

The handheld units measure: |O2 [%]|CO2 [%]|H2S dil. [ppm]|CH4 [%]| Net BTUs [btu/cf]|

There is a log book in the shed
