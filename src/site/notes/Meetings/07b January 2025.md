Derek Willis is the pretreatment guy
Solae shutdown and cleanouts - they'll notify us when, but have not yet

Runyan is going to put in a plant at President's Island
Requested discharge - unknown - will be sent to Maxson
Could impact disinfection operation
They plan to keep both the old and new operations

No other new industries

Colossas, xAI, WRF - mixed messages (up and running vs not discharging)
Expected flow: 1.2 MG, application had 560 gallons per day
