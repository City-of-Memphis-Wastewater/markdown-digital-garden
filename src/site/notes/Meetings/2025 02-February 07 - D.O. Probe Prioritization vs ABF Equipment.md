- [[People/Chris Luss\|Chris Luss]] came to ask if we can put off buying new DO probes for the moment. [[People/Carlton Mull\|Carlton Mull]] spec'ed 14 new DO probes in the aeration basin, which would cost $30k to $40k. That money can be better allocated to components on the new [[Equipment/trickling filter towers\|trickling filter towers]]. [[Contractors/CDM Smith\|CDM Smith]] will have flow to the new [[Equipment/trickling filter towers\|equipment/trickling filter towers]] next month.  Currently, [[Information Heap/dissolved oxygen\|dissolved oxygen]] is taken manually with handheld probes, and the automation is effectively non-functional. I should check in [[People/Pete Gabor\|Pete Gabor]] about the realistic short-term and long-term vision and timeline for these [[Equipment/D.O. probes\|equipment/D.O. probes]] in terms of driving ideal blower speed. The current working assumption is that $40k should instead immediately be allocated to the [[Equipment/ABF towers\|ABF towers]] components in question, and then new [[Equipment/D.O. probes\|D.O. probes]] can be bought after.
