Andre Armstrong wants to know the annual software fee.
Taylor Dennis says: Continued support and updates, and access to the cloud-based software. The pricing has a reoccurring subscription and also a one time professional service fee.
Andre: So support is about training?
Taylor: No, there is also software support.

# Timeline
Eric Boyd:
Timeline to implementation and requirements. Initially, once we gather requirements, we need to complete the BRD and have it signed by SME's. Typically there a few steps. City IT has completed the security assessment. The workflow analysis has been completed. Now we need to do a technology review board. This will review the application, to give approval or denial of the software for the City of Memphis environment. The funds have been encumbered into a contract - usually this comes after the technical review. The Chief Information Officer want to push the kick off at least 8 weeks ( or days?), beyond the current scheduled day of September 12th. Eric wants to have the Technology Review board on September 18th. The PM is currently out of the office and won't return until Monday.

Lori asks Henry what is driving the September 12th date.

Steven Petis is the PM.
