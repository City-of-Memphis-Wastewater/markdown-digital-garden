Ampli-speed
Need a flex coupling
Need to reduce speed and torque for pump #1

Goal: 
- Mechanical fuse, sacrificial weak leak, to mitigate breakage of the shaft via the rigid coupling
- Dial back the speed
- Build a CAD model

Model:
- Falk Steelflex grid coupling


Calculate the max torque - to select a coupling.
- select a target threshold coefficient - Harvey likes 90% of rating - what is standard?
- Consider startup

Questions:
 - Kim: who will engineer it? Design coupling modification
 - What is implied by the capacity rating? What is the baked-in factor of safety?
 - Is the model of the pump the same as its sisters?
 - Who is the manufacturer?

Concern:
- wobble , vibration, at lower speed

Marching orders:
- spec a torque for a mechanical fuse (~Harvey's guess: 90% of spec) that is not too big -
