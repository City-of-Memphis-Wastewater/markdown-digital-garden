What is the difference between the "Sync" button and the "Add shortcut to OneDrive" button in SharePoint Documents?

# ChatGPT 0:
Great question ‚Äî the **"Sync"** and **"Add shortcut to OneDrive"** buttons in **SharePoint Documents** offer different ways of accessing shared files from your computer. Here's a breakdown:

---

### ‚úÖ **"Sync" Button**

**Function:**  
Creates a **local copy** of the SharePoint document library on your computer using **OneDrive sync client**.

**Details:**

- Downloads the full folder (or selected files) to your local machine.
    
- Files are available in **File Explorer** under the organization‚Äôs name.
    
- Changes you make sync **automatically** both ways (cloud ‚ÜîÔ∏è local).
    
- Requires **OneDrive sync app** to be installed and signed in.
    
- Good for **offline access**, large libraries, and frequent collaboration.
    

**Typical Path:**

```
C:\Users\<YourName>\YourOrgName\...
```

**Use when:**

### üìé **"Add shortcut to OneDrive" Button**

**Function:**  
Adds a **shortcut link** to the SharePoint folder inside your **OneDrive web interface** and **OneDrive folder** on your PC.

**Details:**

- Doesn‚Äôt download files immediately.
    
- Shortcut appears in your **OneDrive** under ‚ÄúMy files.‚Äù
    
- It behaves like a **symbolic link** to the SharePoint folder.
    
- Changes reflect in the source, but the link is not a full sync.
    
- Can cause issues if syncing across multiple accounts or libraries.
    

**Typical Path (in OneDrive):**

```
C:\Users\<YourName>\OneDrive - <YourOrgName>\<ShortcutName>
```

**Use when:**

- You want **quick access** to a few SharePoint folders.
