Hypothetical contractor: [[Contractors/Malasari Engineering\|Malasari Engineering]] 

#assignment
Created: [[-Daily Activity Log-/2025 01January 24\|2025 01January 24]]

Is there money in the budget this year? Talk to [[People/Mars\|Mars]]. For FY26. Scratch that, talk to [[People/Gary Garrison\|Gary Garrison]]
We need to get that in ASAP or else all equipment in the mechanical room will be toast within three years, and the PLC's in the control room are at risk as well.

Within the next 10 days, Henry says. But Mike says there is no rush of this sort.

As of [[-Daily Activity Log-/2025 01January 30\|2025 01January 30]], the ball is in [[People/Mike Gross\|Mike Gross]]'s court, in terms of identifying a CFM value.

As of [[-Daily Activity Log-/2025 01January 31\|2025 01January 31]]:

Hello George,
> Yes, sir.Â  We found that about 200 CFM is needed for combustion air for the six (6) gas-fired furnaces in the heating season.
> 
> We are now working with Purfafil for an outside-mounted unit to inject 100% clean air into the mechanical room.
> 
> We should have a proposal and equipment specification for everyoneâ€™s review soon.

> Thanks again for this opportunity,
