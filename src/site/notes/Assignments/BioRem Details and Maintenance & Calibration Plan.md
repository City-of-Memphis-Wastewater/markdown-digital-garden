#assignment  
Contact: [[People/Henry Nakayama\|Henry Nakayama]]
Date: [[-Daily Activity Log-/2025 01-January 31\|2025 01-January 31]]

N:\Treatment Plants\Maxson Plant\TEM Biogas\

Key people: [[People/Carlton Mull\|Carlton Mull]], [[People/Stacy Bullard\|Stacy Bullard]], [[People/Krishna Bejjanki\|Krishna Bejjanki]], [[People/Chris Luss\|Chris Luss]] (unload priority), [[People/Rodney Williams\|Rodney Williams]]

Talk to [[People/Tersea Espy\|people/Tersea Espy]] at [[Contractors/Diamond Scientific\|contractors/Diamond Scientific]] about calibrating [[Equipment/SWG100 biogas analyzer\|equipment/SWG100 biogas analyzer]], the [[Equipment/Optima7 handheld biogas analyzer\|equipment/Optima7 handheld biogas analyzer]], and the [[Equipment/OptimaMax handheld biogas analyzer\|equipment/OptimaMax handheld biogas analyzer]]. Also the 6 [[Equipment/Amatek biogas flow meters\|equipment/Amatek biogas flow meters]] which need to be calibrated, by [[People/Andy LeJeune\|Andy LeJeune]] at [[Contractors/Bar Environmental\|Contractors/Bar Environmental]]. If any of the flow meters cannot be calibrated, [[Contractors/Bar Environmental\|Bar Environmental]] will order new flow meters as we need them. We should have at least six spare [[Equipment/Amatek biogas flow meters\|Amatek biogas flow meters]] on a shelf somewhere - where are they (ask [[People/Chris Luss\|Chris Luss]])? Also ask about where the spare [[Equipment/SWG100 biogas analyzer\|equipment/SWG100 biogas analyzer]] is being stored. Move the storage of the flow meters and analyzers for the [[Systems/BioRem\|BioRem]] system to a rack in my office for now.


- [ ] Write SOP's
- [ ] Set up semi annual periodic maintenance and calibrations, starting in July 2025, January 2026, July 2026, etc
- [ ] Offset PM's and calibrations of handheld units by a month, so that we have at least a handheld while the [[Equipment/SWG100 biogas analyzer\|equipment/SWG100 biogas analyzer]] is in service
- [ ] All major parts and equipment put into [[Software/Hexagon\|Hexagon]], with [[People/Krishna Bejjanki\|Krishna Bejjanki]]
- [ ] Make list of all major parts, with serial numbers and model numbers
- [ ] Keep spare parts on hand
- [ ] Build/acquire shelf for office storage: staples.com, order with [[People/Tieraney Washington\|people/Tieraney Washington]]
Best location for spare parts: 
1. [[People/Clayton Bennett\|Clayton Bennett]]'s office (good for low mass, high sensitivity)
2. The pipe gallery (low [[FailureModes/Hydrogen sulfide\|Hydrogen sulfide]], but high humidity)


Other equipment (?) look for manual, SOP, O&M doc, etc for all [[Systems/BioRem\|BioRem]] equipment. The O&M documents may have been provided by [[Contractors/CDM Smith\|CDM Smith]]. The [[Systems/BioRem\|BioRem]] project was funded by [[Government/TVA\|government/TVA]]. 
- [ ] Ask [[People/Mike Brower\|Mike Brower]] for the location of the [[Systems/BioRem\|BioRem]] O&M docs.
