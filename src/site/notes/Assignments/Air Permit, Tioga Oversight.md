#assignment : Read the air permit, get in touch with Tioga ("ask five good questions")

Communicated by [[People/Henry Nakayama\|Henry Nakayama]]

[[Contractors/Tioga Environmental\|Tioga Environmental]] has some relatively new employees, so monitoring should be extra vigilant

There are several sets of flowmeter
Oxygen and biogas levels in flowmeters: Biogas level should stay below 6% or else the equipment could explore. Balance: The [[Systems/BioRem\|BioRem]] system needs oxygen as well to keep the bugs happy.

Flow meters (smaller) going into each biogas tank.
Some (the main flow meters) were lost replaced by [[Contractors/Bar Environmental\|Contractors/Bar Environmental]].
At the end we have a flow meter of how much gas is going into the flares themselves or to TVA - this flow meter has gone out too in the past, with #failuremode overexposure to oxygen.

Fire arrestors prevent flame from going into the system. The [[Equipment/Fire Arrestors\|Equipment/Fire Arrestors]] themselves burned out due to excessive heat and excessive oxygen. #failuremode. Fire arrestors #1 and #3 were replaced within the 2023-2024 period (citation [[People/Rodney Williams\|people/Rodney Williams]]).
