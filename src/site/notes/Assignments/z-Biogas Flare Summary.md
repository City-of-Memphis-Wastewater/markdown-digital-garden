Audio info from [[People/Rodney Williams\|people/Rodney Williams]]: (C:\Users\george.bennett\OneDrive - City of Memphis\Documents\Projects\0000-Maxson\2023-2024 BioRem Activity\Rodney Williams - BioRem Maintenance 2023-2024.m4a - Shortcut)


[[People/Don Hudgins\|Don Hudgins]]
*George, you should be able to get the maintenance data from Krishna regarding Hexagon data. He may need your guidance how to identify it in the system. Check with Mike Brower for any log books that can be reviewed for Biorem activities so you can start getting up to speed. My other email should explain some of the big picture related to this project. Thanks for your assistance! -* 

- [x] Ask Mike for log books, to review BioRem activites
- [x] Mike said to ask [[People/Chris Luss\|Chris Luss]] for log books
- [x] Speak to Krish about BioRem maintenance data in the Hexagon records - he is working on it
- [x] Recieve [[Systems/BioRem\|BioRem]] system maintenance data from Krish via [[Software/Hexagon\|Hexagon]] - does not exist, Krish will create the system
- [ ] Check weekly [[Contractors/Tioga Environmental\|Tioga Environmental]] field reports on Sharepoint for [[Systems/BioRem\|BioRem]]
	- [ ] [OneDrive](https://memphistngov-my.sharepoint.com/shared?id=%2Fsites%2FPWe%2FEnvironmentalMaintenancePlant%2FShared%20Documents%2FTEM%20Biorem%20Reports&listurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmemphistngov%2Esharepoint%2Ecom%2Fsites%2FPWe%2FEnvironmentalMaintenancePlant%2FShared%20Documents)
- [x] Get Consumables for maintenance list from [[People/Carlton Mull\|Carlton Mull]]: "Equipment, Instrumentation & Spare Parts Catalogue"


Conversation with [[People/Don Hudgins\|Don Hudgins]] at noon, Friday
Anything significant - equipment out of service, spike 
Going to our annual report, in house purposes
Quality control
Sufficient - look 
Trends - look for tripping hazards
Enhanced maintenance for proper maintenance - replacement parts
Understand it

Develop SOP's

Where do SOP's live

Within the next 6-12 months, when we're generating Biogas, we'll be submitting an operation report to the county. 
Look at Tioga's records in the shared drive, for exhaust samples.

Comparable 
Cogen system at Stiles plant - 

CDM Smith is developing SOP's and a manual for operations at the plant - see examples, talk to Mike, look at old operation manuals, SOP's by Black & Veatch from the 90's as an example (a good example to shoot for) - BioRem

What are we doing? Document it as if it's good, while also identifying gaps
Learn reporting requirement to the health department: continuous monitoring, and if not we must have handheld units
- Where does the continuous monitoring data go?
- Connection, Lorde and Company, meant to push data to Ovation -  talk to Peter Gabor
- [ ] Get all BioRem data pulled into WIMS and into Ovation


Tioga takes creek samples, and Henry uses that to do a bi-weekly or monthly report to TVA
Oxygen intrusion - we don't want oxygen in the biogas 

- How charactering negative delta in elemental sulfur?
- Periodic cleaning - be methods- divert wash water to a tank (low pH is a hazard) - settle out, hire a company to put on hazmat suits to apply a base to it or dewater it and get a product 

Optimize, challenge the system with consistent biogas, iterative improvement


Purposes:
- 250 tons a year of SO2 sulfide or else we violate our permit with air compliance
- Business element - paying off the loan


Where is the closest plant that uses biogas - out west.
California
Some people use biogas for engines, if the sulfur content is limited.
Reduced sulfur, high btu
- Get BTU up by decrease amount of oxygen coming in - get cover tight - look for leaks, get them fixed
- BioRem effectiveness
- Iron salt reduces sulfur content - another project all together, to mitigate sulfur coming in, in sewer system
- 1000 ppm of hydrogen sufilde, up to 5000 maybe, is what we can expect to mitigate with a BioRem - more than that it is overwhelmed. 
- Ask [[People/Henry Nakayama\|Henry Nakayama]] / Tioga for ppm numbers. 
- iterative improvement while avoiding catastrophic failure - are we overlooking something, where are the failure modes that will knock out our experiment: the heat exchangers to heat the water, are they being properly maintained
	- What are we doing to #winterize and freeze up the system KEY PRIORITY
	- Look at typical winterizing procedures for other BioRem systems
	- Up in Minnesota, farmers use a lot of biogas (for what?) - livestock waste management, manure digesting. : [Minnesota Biogas and Energy Potential | American Biogas Council](https://americanbiogascouncil.org/resources/state-profiles/minnesota/#:~:text=Minnesota%20ranks%208th%20out%20of%2050%20states%20for,more%21%2046.9%20million%20MMBTU%2Fyr%20space%20heat%20%28869%2C000%20homes%29.)
	- Some cities (California) will concentrate and purify their biogas and put it back on the grid

Recirculation pumps to keep the product in motion (like leaving your sink dripping)

Tioga is tasked with air permit compliance


There has never been a formal commissioning period, because it has never really worked right

Automation operating: flow meters to trigger a sump, talk to Mike 

Filters for sensor

[[People/Chris Luss\|Chris Luss]] says that the [[Systems/BioRem\|BioRem]] system has already been winterized as of early December - it is drained of water and there should be no issues

- Vector attraction reduction
- High residence time is necessary for pathogen reduction and #vector attraction reduction
- The lagoon serving as a biogas reactor (or digester) is secondary
- Great example: [[Organizations/East Bay MUD\|East Bay MUD]]
- To get an actual biogas reactor would cost 30+ million dollars
- Agitate the lagoon with a [[Equipment/Submarine Drone\|equipment/Submarine Drone]]
