[Download CAD Assistant, or learn about it]( www.opencascade.com/products/cad-assistant)

What a great software from [[Software/Open Cascade\|Open Cascade]], freely available. It should be installed on all computers and smartphones possible in my opinion. 

There are many features in [[Software/Pavlov 3D\|Pavlov 3D]] that leverage the features in [[Software/CADAssistant\|CADAssistant]]

Check out this neat feature in [[Software/Obsidian\|Obsidian]], to show nested tree hierarchies for pasted URLs that end in a backslash: [[www.opencascade.com/products/cad-assistant\|cad-assistant]]

[example](www.opencascade.com\products\cad-assistant) <---- every time you click this link it will generate a new instance within the folder tree of the [[www.opencascade.com/products/cad-assistant\|cad-assistant]] entry. 
Each new entry is differentiated automatically using number, which comes after the defined name, with a space between the name and the numeric iterator. '
Like this: *cad-assistant 3*
