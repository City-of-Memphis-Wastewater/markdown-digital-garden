    Because this software’s API was hijacked by ransomware 2 years ago, it is determined to be too risky to put on our network. Please see article: https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/23/a/new-mimic-ransomware-abuses-everything-apis-for-its-encryption-p.html  
      
    This request is denied as a precaution. I would like to ensure that your device and our enterprise are as safe as possible. My annotation will be added to the ticket notes.
