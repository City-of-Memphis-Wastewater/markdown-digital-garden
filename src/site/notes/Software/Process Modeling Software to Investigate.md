ChatGPT Query:
*Please recommend free process modeling softwares Linux, windows, or browser software for modelling water flow through a water treatment plant. I do not need CFD. Examples of software include FluidSim and Dynamita Sumo.*

Answer:
> Certainly! Based on your requirements for free software to model water flow through a water treatment plant (excluding CFD), here are some options:
> 
> 1. **STOAT**: Developed by WRc, STOAT is a PC-based tool designed to dynamically simulate the performance of wastewater treatment works. It can model individual treatment processes or entire treatment plants, including sludge processes and recycling.
